	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate retrospectively gated spiral readout four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI for intracardiac flow analysis.
METHODS: Retrospectively gated spiral 4D flow MRI was implemented on a 1.5-tesla scanner. The spiral sequence was compared against conventional Cartesian 4D flow (SENSE [sensitivity encoding] 2) in seven healthy volunteers and three patients (only spiral). In addition to comparing flow values, linear regression was used to assess internal consistency of aortic versus pulmonary net volume flows and left ventricular inflow versus outflow using quantitative pathlines analysis.
RESULTS: Total scan time with spiral 4D flow was 44% $\pm$ 6% of the Cartesian counterpart (13 $\pm$ 3 vs. 31 $\pm$ 7 min). Aortic versus pulmonary flow correlated strongly for the spiral sequence (P < 0.05, slope = 1.03, R(2) = 0.88, N = 10), whereas the linear relationship for the Cartesian sequence was not significant (P = 0.06, N = 7). Pathlines analysis indicated good data quality for the spiral (P < 0.05, slope = 1.02, R(2) = 0.90, N = 10) and Cartesian sequence (P < 0.05, slope = 1.10, R(2) = 0.93, N = 7). Spiral and Cartesian peak flow rate (P < 0.05, slope = 0.96, R(2) = 0.72, N = 14), peak velocity (P < 0.05, slope = 1.00, R(2) = 0.81, N = 14), and pathlines flow components (P < 0.05, slope = 1.04, R(2) = 0.87, N = 28) correlated well.
CONCLUSION: Retrospectively gated spiral 4D flow MRI permits more than two-fold reduction in scan time compared to conventional Cartesian 4D flow MRI, while maintaining similar data quality. Magn Reson Med, 2015. {\copyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess image quality of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging before and after administration of a T1-shortening ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide blood pool agent (NC100150). 3D cardiac cine MR imaging was performed in 13 volunteers using a radiofrequency-spoiled cardiac-gated 3D cine gradient-echo sequence with short repetition and echo times. Compared with precontrast images, postcontrast images showed no enhancement in fat and skeletal muscle, moderate enhancement in myocardium, and significant enhancement in ventricular cavity. After contrast injection, the signal ratio of the ventricular chamber to the myocardium significantly increased, and dramatic improvements were seen in the quality of the cineangiographic images and the depiction of cardiac valves. This quantitative study has shown that 3D cardiac cine MR imaging using a blood pool agent provided MR ventriculography and cineangiography with excellent image quality.},

@article{Neuwelt:2007aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ferumoxytol, an iron oxide nanoparticle that targets phagocytic cells, can be used in magnetic resonance imaging of malignant brain tumors and can be administered as a bolus, allowing dynamic imaging. Our objectives were to determine the optimum time of delayed contrast enhancement of ferumoxytol, and to compare ferumoxytol and gadolinium contrast agents for magnetic resonance angiography and perfusion.
METHODS: Twelve patients with malignant brain tumors underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging multiple times up to 72 hours after ferumoxytol injection at both 1.5 and 3-T. The enhancement time course was determined for ferumoxytol and compared with a baseline gadolinium scan. Perfusion, time-of-flight and dynamic magnetic resonance angiography and T1-weighted scans were compared for the two agents.
RESULTS: The lesions were detectable at all field strengths, even with an intraoperative 0.15-T magnet. Maximal ferumoxytol enhancement intensity was at 24 to 28 hours after administration, and the enhancing volume subsequently expanded with time into a non-gadolinium-enhancing, high T2-weighted signal region of tumor-infiltrated brain. Dynamic studies were assessed with both agents, indicating early vascular leak with gadolinium but not with ferumoxytol.
CONCLUSION: Our most important finding was that gadolinium leaks out of blood vessels early after injection, whereas ferumoxytol stays intravascular in the "early" phase, thereby increasing the accuracy of tumor perfusion assessment. As a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, ferumoxytol visualizes brain tumors at all field strengths evaluated, with delayed enhancement peaking at 24 to 28 hours after administration.},

	Abstract = {Conventional constant angular velocity sampling of the surface of a sphere results in a higher sampling density near the two poles relative to the equatorial region. More samples, and hence longer sampling time, are required to achieve a given sampling density in the equatorial region when compared with uniform sampling. This paper presents a simple expression for a continuous sample path through a nearly uniform distribution of points on the surface of a sphere. Sampling of concentric spherical shells in k-space with the new strategy is used to design 3D selective inversion and spin-echo pulses. These new 3D selective pulses have been implemented and verified experimentally.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative blood flow and aspects of regional myocardial function such as myocardial displacement and strain can be measured using phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR). Since a gadolinium-based contrast agent is often used to measure myocardial infarct size, we sought to determine whether the contrast agent affects measurements of aortic flow and myocardial displacement and strain. Phase-contrast data pre and post contrast agent was acquired during free breathing using 1.5T PC-CMR.
RESULTS: For aortic flow and regional myocardial function 12 and 17 patients were analysed, respectively. The difference pre and post contrast agent was 0.03$\pm$0.16 l/min for cardiac output, and 0.1$\pm$0.5 mm for myocardial displacement. Linear regression for myocardial displacement (MD) after and before contrast agent (CA) showed MDpostCA=0.95MDpreCA+0.05 (r=0.95, p<0.001). For regional myocardial function, the contrast-to-noise ratios for left ventricular myocardial wall versus left ventricular lumen were pre and post contrast agent administration 7.4$\pm$3.3 and 4.4$\pm$8.9, respectively (p<0.001). The contrast-to-noise ratios for left ventricular myocardial wall versus surrounding tissue were pre and post contrast agent administration -16.9$\pm$22 and -0.2$\pm$6.3, respectively (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative measurements of aortic flow yield equal results both in the absence and presence of gadolinium contrast agent. The total examination time may thereby be reduced when assessing both viability and quantitative flow using PC-CMR, by assessing aortic flow post contrast agent administration. Phase-contrast information for myocardial displacement is also assessable both in the absence and presence of contrast agent. However, delineation of the myocardium may be difficult or impossible post contrast agent due to the lower image contrast. Acquisition of myocardial displacement should therefore be performed pre contrast agent using current PC-CMR sequences.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: A high-quality, reproducible, multi-slice T2-mapping protocol for the mouse heart is presented.
METHODS: A T2-prepared sequence with composite 90$\,^{\circ}$ and 180$\,^{\circ}$ radiofrequency pulses in a segmented MLEV phase cycling scheme was developed. The T2-mapping protocol was optimized using simulations and evaluated with phantoms.
RESULTS: Repeatability for determination of myocardial T2 values was assessed in vivo in n = 5 healthy mice on 2 different days. The average baseline T2 of the left ventricular myocardium was 22.5 $\pm$ 1.7 ms. The repeatability coefficient for R2 = 1/T2 for measurements at different days was ΔR2 = 6.3 s(−1). Subsequently, T2 mapping was applied in comparison to late-gadolinium-enhancement (LGE) imaging, to assess 1-day-old ischemia/reperfusion (IR) myocardial injury in n = 8 mice. T2 in the infarcts was significantly higher than in remote tissue, whereas remote tissue was not significantly different from baseline. Infarct sizes based on T2 versus LGE showed strong correlation. To assess the time-course of T2 changes in the infarcts, T2 mapping was performed at day 1, 3, and 7 after IR injury in a separate group of mice (n = 16). T2 was highest at day 3, in agreement with the expected time course of edema formation and resolution after myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSION: T2 prepared imaging provides high quality reproducible T2 maps of healthy and diseased mouse myocardium.},

	Abstract = {Time-resolved phase contrast (PC) MRI with velocity encoding in three directions (flow-sensitive four-dimensional MRI) can be employed to assess three-dimensional blood flow in the entire aortic lumen within a single measurement. These data can be used not only for the visualization of blood flow but also to derive additional information on vascular geometry with three-dimensional PC MR angiography (MRA). As PC-MRA is sensitive to available signal-to-noise ratio, standard and novel blood pool contrast agents may help to enhance PC-MRA image quality. In a group of 30 healthy volunteers, the influence of different contrast agents on vascular signal-to-noise ratio, PC-MRA quality, and subsequent three-dimensional stream-line visualization in the thoracic aorta was determined. Flow-sensitive four-dimensional MRI data acquired with contrast agent provided significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio in magnitude data and noise reduction in velocity data compared to measurements without contrast media. The agreement of three-dimensional PC-MRA with reference standard contrast-enhanced MRA was good for both contrast agents, with improved PC-MRA performance for blood pool contrast agent, particularly for the smaller supra-aortic branches. For three-dimensional flow visualization, a trend toward improved results for the data with contrast agent was observed.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a fast protocol for ultra-short echo time (UTE) Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the beating murine heart. The sequence involves a self-gated UTE with golden-angle radial acquisition and compressed sensing reconstruction. The self-gated acquisition is performed asynchronously with the heartbeat, resulting in a randomly undersampled kt-space that facilitates compressed sensing reconstruction. The sequence was tested in 4 healthy rats and 4 rats with chronic myocardial infarction, approximately 2 months after surgery. As a control, a non-accelerated self-gated multi-slice FLASH sequence with an echo time (TE) of 2.76 ms, 4.5 signal averages, a matrix of 192 × 192, and an acquisition time of 2 min 34 s per slice was used to obtain Cine MRI with 15 frames per heartbeat. Non-accelerated UTE MRI was performed with TE = 0.29 ms, a reconstruction matrix of 192 × 192, and an acquisition time of 3 min 47 s per slice for 3.5 averages. Accelerated imaging with 2×, 4× and 5× undersampled kt-space data was performed with 1 min, 30 and 15 s acquisitions, respectively. UTE Cine images up to 5× undersampled kt-space data could be successfully reconstructed using a compressed sensing algorithm. In contrast to the FLASH Cine images, flow artifacts in the UTE images were nearly absent due to the short echo time, simplifying segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) lumen. LV functional parameters derived from the control and the accelerated Cine movies were statistically identical.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetically manipulated animals like mice or rabbits play an important role in the exploration of human cardiovascular diseases. It is therefore important to identify animal models that closely mimic physiological and pathological human cardiac function.
METHODS: In-vivo phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was used to measure regional three-directional left ventricular myocardial motion with high temporal resolution in mice (N=18), rabbits (N=8), and humans (N=20). Radial, long-axis, and rotational myocardial velocities were acquired in left ventricular basal, mid-ventricular, and apical short-axis locations.
RESULTS: Regional analysis revealed different patterns of motion: 1) In humans and rabbits, the apex showed slower radial velocities compared to the base. 2) Significant differences within species were seen in the pattern of long-axis motion. Long-axis velocities during systole were fairly homogeneously distributed in mice, whereas humans showed a dominant component in the lateral wall and rabbits in the base. 3) Rotational velocities and twist showed the most distinct patterns in both temporal evolution and relative contribution of base, mid-ventricle and apex, respectively. Interestingly, a marked difference in rotational behavior during early-systole was found in mice, which exhibited clockwise rotation in all slice locations compared to counter-clockwise rotation in rabbits and humans.
CONCLUSIONS: Phase contrast CMR revealed subtle, but significantly different regional myocardial motion patterns in mice, rabbits and humans. This finding has to be considered when investigating myocardial motion pattern in small animal models of heart disease.},

	Abstract = {MRI has become an important tool to noninvasively assess global and regional cardiac function, infarct size, or myocardial blood flow in surgically or genetically modified mouse models of human heart disease. Constraints on scan time due to sensitivity to general anesthesia in hemodynamically compromised mice frequently limit the number of parameters available in one imaging session. Parallel imaging techniques to reduce acquisition times require coil arrays, which are technically challenging to design at ultrahigh magnetic field strengths. This work validates the use of an eight-channel volume phased-array coil for cardiac MRI in mice at 9.4 T. Two- and three-dimensional sequences were combined with parallel imaging techniques and used to quantify global cardiac function, T(1)-relaxation times and infarct sizes. Furthermore, the rapid acquisition of functional cine-data allowed for the first time in mice measurement of left-ventricular peak filling and ejection rates under intravenous infusion of dobutamine. The results demonstrate that a threefold accelerated data acquisition is generally feasible without compromising the accuracy of the results. This strategy may eventually pave the way for routine, multiparametric phenotyping of mouse hearts in vivo within one imaging session of tolerable duration.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been associated with the development of a potentially fatal disorder, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is an alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it carries the risk of radiation exposure and further reduction of residual renal function. Therefore we sought to assess the feasibility of ferumoxytol as an alternative to GBCA for contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA) in a pediatric cohort with CKD. Ferumoxytol is a parenteral iron supplement that contains ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) and is a potent relaxivity agent for MRI.
METHODS: We describe the MRI findings in ten pediatric patients who needed detailed vascular mapping. Ferumoxytol (4 mg/kg) was administered intravenously for contrast-enhanced MRA. The patients tolerated the procedure without complications.
RESULTS: Resulting studies were highly diagnostic and were pivotal in guiding patient management. The images were notable for clear delineation of multiple vascular occlusions.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the concerns associated with the use of GBCAs in renal failure, ferumoxytol is an excellent alternative contrast agent in pediatric end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Future studies are needed in order to further evaluate safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol in this patient population.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIOs) based contrast agent (AMI 227), in a transverse three-dimensional time-of-flight TONE MR angiography sequence of abdominal aorta in rabbits. The main goal was to assess improvement in the visualization of small arteries such as renal arteries, when using such a sequence. Imaging experiments were performed on a 1.5 T magnet, using a transverse 3D time-of-flight (TOF) tilted optimized nonsaturating excitation (TONE) sequence with magnetization transfer suppression. The contrast media used were composed of a USPIO core surrounded by a dextran-surfactant (AMI 227). Different concentrations of AMI 227 were evaluated in 12 rabbits. Concentrations varied within the range 8.5-34 micromol Fe/kg - bw: 8.5 micromol Fe/kg (three rabbits); 17 micromol Fe/kg (three rabbits); 25.5 micromol Fe/kg (three rabbits); 34 micromol Fe/kg (three rabbits). A visual analysis based on the improvement of visualization of small arteries (renal arteries) on MIP images and a quantitative analysis based on the percentage of contrast enhancement of the aorta plotted against distance in the slab from the top edge of the acquisition volume were obtained. A signal-to-noise ratio enhancement of the distal part of the aorta and only improvement in the delineation of the renal arteries were noted when using low concentrations of the contrast media. A loss of signal-to-noise ratio of the aorta and a decrease in arterial visualization were respectively noted with higher concentration of contrast media. In this experimental study, using a transverse three-dimensional TOF TONE MR angiography sequence of renal arteries, in which sequence the saturation effect is minimized, the use of AMI 227 allows only improvement in the delineation of small arteries when using low concentrations of contrast media.},

@article{Jung:2014aa,
	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Contrast-enhancing magnetic resonance mechanism, employing either positive or negative signal changes, has contrast-specific signal characteristics. Although highly sensitive, negative contrast typically decreases the resolution and spatial specificity of MRI, whereas positive contrast lacks a high contrast-to-noise ratio but offers high spatial accuracy. To overcome these individual limitations, dual-contrast acquisitions were performed using iron oxide nanoparticles and a pair of MRI acquisitions. Specifically, vascular signals in MR angiography were positively enhanced using ultrashort echo (UTE) acquisition, which provided highly resolved vessel structures with increased vessel/tissue contrast. In addition, fast low angle shot (FLASH) acquisition yielded strong negative vessel contrast, resulting in the higher number of discernible vessel branches than those obtained from the UTE method. Taken together, the high sensitivity of the negative contrast delineated ambiguous vessel regions, whereas the positive contrast effectively eliminated the false negative contrast areas (e.g., airways and bones), demonstrating the benefits of the dual-contrast method.
FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: In this study, the MRI properties of iron oxide nanoparticles were studied in an animal model. These contrast agents are typically considered negative contrast materials, leading to signal loss on T2* weighted images, but they also have known T1 effects as well, which is lower than that of standard positive contrast agents (like gadolinium or manganese) but is still detectable. This dual property was utilized in this study, demonstrating high sensitivity of the negative contrast in delineating ambiguous vessel regions, whereas the positive contrast eliminated false negative contrast areas (areas giving rise to susceptibility effects).},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and evaluate a practical method for the quantification of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on coronary MR angiograms (MRA) acquired with parallel imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To quantify the spatially varying noise due to parallel imaging reconstruction, a new method has been implemented incorporating image data acquisition followed by a fast noise scan during which radiofrequency pulses, cardiac triggering and navigator gating are disabled. The performance of this method was evaluated in a phantom study where SNR measurements were compared with those of a reference standard (multiple repetitions). Subsequently, SNR of myocardium and posterior skeletal muscle was determined on in vivo human coronary MRA.
RESULTS: In a phantom, the SNR measured using the proposed method deviated less than 10.1% from the reference method for small geometry factors (≤2). In vivo, the noise scan for a 10 min coronary MRA acquisition was acquired in 30 s. Higher signal and lower SNR, due to spatially varying noise, were found in myocardium compared with posterior skeletal muscle.
CONCLUSION: SNR quantification based on a fast noise scan is a validated and easy-to-use method when applied to three-dimensional coronary MRA obtained with parallel imaging as long as the geometry factor remains low.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Conventional MRI using contrast agents is semiquantitative because it is inherently sensitive to extravoxular susceptibility artifacts, field inhomogeneity, partial voluming, perivascular effects, and motion/flow artifacts. Herein we demonstrate a quantitative contrast-enhanced MRI technique using ultrashort time-to-echo pulse sequences for measuring clinically relevant concentrations of ferumoxytol, a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle contrast agent with high sensitivity and precision in vitro and in vivo.
METHODS: The method achieves robust, reproducible results by using rapid signal acquisition at ultrashort time-to-echo (UTE) to produce positive contrast images with pure T1 weighting and little T2 * decay. The spoiled gradient echo equation is used to transform UTE intensities directly into concentration using experimentally determined relaxivity constants and image acquisition parameters.
RESULTS: A multiparametric optimization of acquisition parameters revealed an optimal zone capable of producing high-fidelity measurements. Clinically relevant intravascular concentrations of ferumoxytol were measured longitudinally in mice with high sensitivity and precision (∼7.1% error). MRI measurements were independently validated by elemental iron analysis of sequential blood draws. Automated segmentation of ferumoxytol concentration yielded high quality three-dimensional images for visualization of perfusion.
CONCLUSIONS: This ability to longitudinally quantify blood pool CA concentration is unique to quantitative UTE contrast-enhanced (QUTE-CE) MRI and makes QUTE-CE MRI competitive with nuclear imaging. Magn Reson Med 000:000-000, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a major challenge to sodium magnetic resonance imaging. Phased array coils have been shown significantly improving SNR in proton imaging over volume coils. This study investigates SNR advantage of a 15-channel array head coil (birdcage volume coil for transmit/receive and 15-channel array insert for receive-only) in sodium imaging at 7 T. Phantoms and healthy human brains were scanned on a whole-body 7 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner using a customer-developed pulse sequence with the twisted projection imaging trajectory. Noise-only images were acquired with blanked radiofrequency excitations for noise measurement on a pixel basis. SNR was calculated on the root of sum-of-squares images. When compared with the volume coil, the 15-channel array produced SNR more than doubled at the periphery and slightly increased at the center of the phantoms and human brains. Decorrelation of noise across channels of the array coil extended the SNR-doubled region into deep area of the brain. The spatial modulation of element sensitivities on the sum-of-squares combined image was removed by performing self-calibrated sensitivity encoding parallel image reconstruction and uniform image intensity across entire field of view was attained. The 15-channel array coil is an efficient tool to substantially improve SNR in sodium imaging on human brain.},

It is shown that the SNR can be found by correcting the measured signal intensity for the noise bias effects and by evaluating the noise variance as the mean square value of all the pixel intensities in a chosen background ROI, divided by twice the number of receivers used. Estimated SNR values are shown to vary spatially within a bound of 20% with respect to the true SNR values as a result of noise correlations between receivers.},

	Abstract = {The method for phased array image reconstruction of uniform noise images may be used in conjunction with proper image scaling as a means of reconstructing images directly in SNR units. This facilitates accurate and precise SNR measurement on a per pixel basis. This method is applicable to root-sum-of-squares magnitude combining, B(1)-weighted combining, and parallel imaging such as SENSE. A procedure for image reconstruction and scaling is presented, and the method for SNR measurement is validated with phantom data. Alternative methods that rely on noise only regions are not appropriate for parallel imaging where the noise level is highly variable across the field-of-view. The purpose of this article is to provide a nuts and bolts procedure for calculating scale factors used for reconstructing images directly in SNR units. The procedure includes scaling for noise equivalent bandwidth of digital receivers, FFTs and associated window functions (raw data filters), and array combining.},

	Abstract = {New investigations in MRI of a mouse heart showed high-contrast cardiac images and thereby the possibility of doing functional cardiac studies of in vivo mice. But is MRI, in addition, capable of visualizing microstructures such as the coronary arteries and the heart valves of a living mouse? To answer this question, 2D and 3D gradient echo sequences with and without flow compensation were used to image the coronary arteries. To increase signal-to-noise ratio, a birdcage resonator was optimized for mouse heart imaging. Contrast between blood and myocardium was achieved through the inflow effect. A segmented three-dimensional FLASH sequence acquired with a multiple overlap thin slab technique showed the best results. With this technique an isotropic resolution of 100 microm was achieved. The left coronary artery could be visualized up to the apex of the heart. This is demonstrated with short axis views and 3D surface reconstructions of the mouse heart. The four cardiac valves were also visible with the 3D method.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was the serial investigation of morphological and functional changes after left coronary artery ligation in the intact rat using cine-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI studies were performed 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI) with an echocardiogram (ECG)-triggered cine-fast low-angle shot (FLASH)-sequence in a 7-Tesla magnet. MI-size, left ventricular (LV) mass and volumes, cardiac index, ejection fraction (EF), and remote wall and scar thickness of 11 Wistar rats were compared to four sham-operated rats. Stress MRI with dobutamine (10 microl/kg x minute) was performed at 16 weeks. In MI groups (small MI < 30%, N = 5, large MI > 30%, N = 6), there was significant increase of LV mass (small MI + 47.8% increase, large MI + 74.1%) and wall thickness (large MI 1.21 +/- 0.03 to 1.84 +/- 0.07 mm). Scar thickness declined from four to 16 weeks (large MI 0.92 +/- 0.06 to 0.38 +/- 0.02 mm, P < 0.05). End-diastolic volume of both MI groups was significantly elevated but increased further only in animals with large MI from four to 16 weeks (657.1 +/- 38.6 to 869.7 +/- 60.7 microL, P < 0.05). Compared to sham, EF was significantly depressed in MI (large MI 31.5 +/- 2.0%). Wall thickening declined from four to 16 weeks post-MI (large MI 50.9 +/- 9.9 to 28.9 +/- 4.4%, P < 0.05). During stress, sham and MI rats increased wall thickening from 66.5 +/- 8.2 to 111.2 +/- 6.7% and from 30.8 +/- 4.3 to 47.5 +/- 5.8%, respectively (P < 0.05). Hypertrophy was found in all animals with MI throughout the entire period of observation, whereas dilatation after four weeks was only detected in animals with large MI. These morphologic changes were accompanied by an early decline of EF; myocardial function characterized by wall thickening deteriorated later.},

	Abstract = {Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) prevents chronic hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension and associated right ventricle dysfunction in rats. In this animal model, reoxygenation following hypoxia reverses pulmonary hypertension but not right ventricle dysfunction. We thus studied the effect of DHEA on the right ventricle after reoxygenation, i.e. after a normoxic recovery phase secondary to chronic hypoxia in rats. Right ventricle function was assessed in vivo by Doppler echocardiography and in vitro by the isolated perfused heart technique in three groups of animals: control, recovery (21 days of hypoxia followed by 21 days of normoxia) and recovery DHEA (30 mg · kg(-1) every 2 days during the recovery phase). Right ventricle tissue was assessed by optical and electron microscopy. DHEA abolished right ventricle diastolic dysfunction, as the echographic E wave remained close to that of controls (mean $\pm$ SD 76.5 $\pm$ 2.4 and 79.7 $\pm$ 1.7 cm · s(-1), respectively), whereas it was diminished to 40.3 $\pm$ 3.7 in the recovery group. DHEA also abolished right ventricle systolic dysfunction, as shown by the inhibition of the increase in the slope of the pressure-volume curve in isolated heart. The DHEA effect was related to cardiac myocytes proliferation. In conclusion, DHEA prevents right ventricle dysfunction in this animal model by preventing cardiomyocyte alteration.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinically, the effect of chronic hypoxia (CH) in the pulmonary circulation alternates between phases of pulmonary artery hypertension (CH-PAHT) and normoxic normotensive remission (N-RE). Little information is available on the role of calcium-sensitive potassium channels (BK(Ca)) in both CH-PAHT and N-RE phases. In the present study, we investigated the effects of both CH and N-RE on BK(Ca) channels activity and their consequences on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV).
METHODS: Using isolated ring preparation, the patch-clamp technique, RT-PCR and Western immunoblotting, we examined the role of the BK(Ca) channel in normoxic, CH-PAHT and N-RE rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs).
RESULTS: In intrapulmonary arterial rings, acute hypoxia induced contraction in control vessels, relaxation in the N-RE rats, and had no effect in CH-PAHT. The hypoxia-induced relaxation in the N-RE rat pulmonary arteries was abolished by iberiotoxin (IbTx), a specific BK(Ca) blocker. The IbTx-sensitive whole-cell K(Ca) channel current was reduced in CH-PAHT and increased in N-RE rat PASMCs. The BK(Ca) channel conductance and voltage sensitivity were not altered in CH and N-RE rat PASMCs, whereas its calcium sensitivity was decreased and increased in CH and N-RE rat PASMCs, respectively. Results of RT-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed a decrease in the mRNA and protein of the BK(Ca) alpha-subunit in CH, whereas no change at protein level was observed in the N-RE.
CONCLUSION: In rat PASMCs, CH and N-RE are associated with a down- and up-regulation of BK(Ca) activity, respectively, mainly due to modifications of its Ca(2+) sensitivity. This could explain the acute hypoxic pulmonary constriction and relaxation observed in CH and N-RE rats, respectively.},

@article{Bonnet:2002aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chronic hypoxia (CH) induces selective pulmonary hypertension which is accompanied by structural and functional alterations in the pulmonary vasculature. Little information is available on the regression of CH-induced functional alterations of pulmonary wall. In the present work, we investigated the reversal of CH-induced pulmonary hypertension with a special focus on alterations in the electrophysiological properties of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PAMCs) after normoxia recovery.
METHODS: Rats were exposed to a hypobaric environment for 3 weeks (CH rats) and then subjected to a normoxic environment for 3 weeks (normoxia-recovery group) and compared with rats maintained in a normoxic environment (control rats). Electrophysiological properties of PAMCs were studied using conventional microelectrodes and patch-clamp technique.
RESULTS: CH rats exhibited a threefold increase in pulmonary blood pressure compared to control rats and this increase was fully reversed following 3 weeks of normoxia. PAMCs from CH rats were depolarised (about 20 mV), had an elevated calcium concentration and exhibited a hypersensitivity to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) of membrane potential as well as the tone of arterial rings compared with tissues from control rats. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings indicated that voltage gated potassium channel currents I(Kv) and I(K(N)) were decreased in PAMCs from CH rats with a hyper sensitivity of I(K(N)) to 4-AP. CH-induced alterations in electrophysiological properties of PAMCs were also fully reversed after 3 weeks of normoxia recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: Both the increase in the pulmonary blood pressure and alterations in electrophysiological properties of PASMCs simultaneously reverse after normoxia recovery. This complete reversibility of all of the CH-induced pulmonary vascular alterations suggests that curative treatments for PAHT may now be designed aimed at targeting the very limited key factors implicated in hypoxia sensing.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reversibility of right ventricular (RV) remodelling after pulmonary artery hypertension (PAHT) secondary to 3 wk of hypobaric hypoxia. A group of 10 adult male Wistar rats were studied and were the following: control normoxic (C), after 3 wk of chronic hypoxia (CH), and after 3 wk of exposure to hypoxia followed by 3 wk of normoxia recovery (N-RE). Mean pulmonary artery pressure was 11 +/- 2 mmHg in the C group, 35 +/- 2 mmHg in the CH group, and 14 +/- 3 mmHg in the N-RE group. RV function was assessed by echocardiography. In the CH group, the pulmonary flow measured in Doppler mode depicted a midsystolic notch and a decrease of the pulmonary acceleration time compared with control [17 +/- 1 vs. 34 +/- 1 ms (n = 10), respectively; P < 0.05]. RV thickening measured in M-mode was apparent in the CH group compared with the control group [2.84 +/- 0.40 vs. 1.73 +/- 0.26 mm (n = 10), P < 0.05]. In the N-RE group, the RV wall was significantly thinner compared with the CH group [1.56 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.73 +/- 0.26 mm (n = 10), P < 0.05]. The calculated RV diameter shortness fraction was not different between the CH group and C group (34 +/- 4.2% vs. 36 +/- 2.8%) but decreased in the N-RE group [20 +/- 2.4% (n = 10), P < 0.01]. The E-to-A wave ratio on the tricuspid Doppler inflow was significantly lower in the CH group and N-RE group compared with the C group [0.70 +/- 0.8 and 0.72 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.2 (n = 10), respectively; P < 0.05]. In the isolated perfused heart using the Langendorff method, RV compliance was increased in the CH group and decreased in the N-RE group. In the N-RE group, fibrous bands with metaplasia were observed on histological sections of the RV free wall. We conclude that PAHT induces nonreversible RV dysfunction with dysplasia.},

	Abstract = {The background underpinning the clinical use of ultrashort echo-time (UTE) pulse sequences for imaging tissues or tissue components with short T2s is reviewed. Tissues properties are discussed, and tissues are divided into those with a majority of short T2 relaxation components and those with a minority. Features of the basic physics relevant to UTE imaging are described including the fact that when the radiofrequency pulse duration is of the order T2, rotation of tissue magnetization into the transverse plane is incomplete. Consequences of the broad line-width of short T2 components are also discussed including their partial saturation by off-resonance fat suppression pulses as well as multislice and multiecho imaging. The need for rapid data acquisition of the order T2 is explained. The basic UTE pulse sequence with its half excitation pulse and radial imaging from the center of k-space is described together with options that suppress fat and/or long T2 components. Image interpretation is discussed. Clinical features of the imaging of cortical bone, tendons, ligaments, menisci, and periosteum as well as brain, liver, and spine are illustrated. Short T2 components in all of these tissues may show high signals. Possible future developments are outlined as are technical limitations.},

	Abstract = {The efficiency of balanced versus unbalanced techniques for phase-angle-based velocity magnitude and direction imaging is investigated. Methods having balanced flow-encoding gradients (gradients in positive and negative directions with a zero center of gravity) are compared with unbalanced methods. For three-dimensional imaging, a currently used balanced method is the six-point technique having opposed gradients pairs for each orthogonal direction. A currently used unbalanced method is a four-point null technique which has three orthogonal gradients and an additional acquisition having no specific flow encoding to correct the baseline (null) phase. In the gradient-limited case of slow flow and perfusion, the balanced method is predicted to have higher velocity magnitude-to-noise ratio per time (SNRV) by a factor of 1.63, with similar results for velocity direction. In the wraparound-limited case of faster flows and motions, similar results are found when a null acquisition is added to the balanced method. This results in a seven-point balanced method having an SNRV 1.51 times that of the four-point unbalanced method. If null phases are within the [-pi/2,pi/2] interval, this additional null acquisition is unnecessary. Other four-point methods are also considered. These results indicate that, in general, balanced methods have advantages over unbalanced methods for velocity imaging.},

	Abstract = {The dynamic range of phase-reconstructed magnetic resonance images is compared to that of magnitude-reconstructed images. From analysis of propagation of errors, the phase angle noise is phase-independent and given in radians by sigma ([I])/[I], the noise-to-signal ratio of the corresponding magnitude-reconstructed image. As the phase can range from minus pi to pi, the phase angle dynamic range is 2 pi times that of the signal magnitude. These results agree with experiment, verifying that the noise in the two receiver channels is uncorrelated. An artifact-free technique is presented for correcting phase spillover, which further extends the phase angle dynamic range. The reconstruction-based reference phase is adjusted on a local basis so that the boundary of phase wraparound is reconstructed near the center of the [- pi, pi] interval. For a particular flow study, the phase signal-to-noise was extended over twofold by spillover correction, to a value 15 times that of the magnitude signal-to-noise.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To validate a novel approach for accelerated four-dimensional phase contrast MR imaging (4D PC-MRI) with an extended range of velocity sensitivity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 4D PC-MRI data were acquired with a radially undersampled trajectory (PC-VIPR). A dual V(enc) (dV(enc) ) processing algorithm was implemented to investigate the potential for scan time savings while providing an improved velocity-to-noise ratio. Flow and velocity measurements were compared with a flow pump, conventional 2D PC MR, and single V(enc) 4D PC-MRI in the chest of 10 volunteers.
RESULTS: Phantom measurements showed excellent agreement between accelerated dV(enc) 4D PC-MRI and the pump flow rate (R(2) ≥ 0.97) with a three-fold increase in measured velocity-to-noise ratio (VNR) and a 5% increase in scan time. In volunteers, reasonable agreement was found when combining 100% of data acquired with V(enc) = 80 cm/s and 25% of the high V(enc) data, providing the VNR of a 80 cm/s acquisition with a wider velocity range of 160 cm/s at the expense of a 25% longer scan.
CONCLUSION: Accelerated dual V(enc) 4D PC-MRI was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This acquisition scheme is well suited for vascular territories with wide ranges of flow velocities such as congenital heart disease, the hepatic vasculature, and others.},

	Abstract = {Angiographic displays of cerebral vessels can be generated with single-excitation three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Differentiation of true stenosis from artifactual signal loss, due to dephasing effects from fast or nonconstant blood flow and field inhomogeneities, poses a significant clinical problem that can be largely resolved with the use of very short echo times (TEs). A three-dimensional imaging technique was developed that allows TEs of 3.1 msec without and 4.5 msec with first-order flow compensation gradients. The short TEs were achieved with short asymmetric radio-frequency pulses, gradients of minimal duration, and fractional echoes. Significantly improved images of normal tortuous vessels with fast flow were obtained. With this method, accuracy in depicting the vessel lumen and confidence in the findings were markedly increased.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The rat caudal disc has been increasingly used in studying of disc degeneration because of its simplicity, low cost, and efficiency. However, the reproducibility and standardization are essential to facilitate the investigations of biologic therapeutics at different stages of degeneration.
PURPOSE: To identify the effect of different needle gauges to the degenerative response in rat caudal discs and to examine its pathogenesis by looking at the cellular and matrix changes.
STUDY DESIGN: In vivo study of injury-induced rat caudal disc degeneration using needle puncture.
PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-six Lewis rats aged 12-14 weeks.
OUTCOME MEASURES: The induced degenerative discs were analyzed by plain radiograph, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological examination. Proteoglycan content was assessed by alcian blue stain. Immunohistochemistry using aggrecan, collagen II, and Sox-9 was also evaluated to investigate cell differentiation and matrix changes.
METHODS: All rats were divided into three groups according to different needle gauges (18G, 20G, and 22G). Caudal discs were punctured percutaneously under image guidance. Radiographs and MRI were obtained at 2 weeks interval until 8 weeks. At each time point, three rats from each group were sacrificed for histological analysis and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Larger needle gauges, especially 18G, produced more deterioration of the disc when compared with smaller sizes, particularly with time. Significant differences were identified in almost all parameters compared between 18G and 22G at the 8-week time point. For the effect of time in the same needle size, the differences occurred between 2- or 4-week and 8-week time point in the 18G and 20G groups. The proteoglycan and aggrecan stain gradually decreased over time. Chondrogenic differentiation was identified within the degenerative disc by detecting Sox-9 positive cells and collagen II accumulation increased as degeneration progressed.
CONCLUSIONS: The puncture-induced degenerative changes in rat caudal discs can imitate the human degenerative cascade as observed in plain radiograph, MRI, histology, and immunohistochemistry. We suggest that needle size affects the occurrence of progression of degeneration; thus, the large needle size was required to accelerate the deterioration. The size of needle and time point after injury should be considered when investigating the effect of therapeutic materials to retard degeneration or regenerate the intervertebral disc.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A large percentage of back pain can be attributed to degeneration of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) is known to play an important role in chondrogenesis of the IVD. Simvastatin is known to upregulate expression of BMP-2. Thus, we hypothesized that intradiscal injection of simvastatin in a rat model of degenerative disc disease (DDD) would result in retardation of DDD.
PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to develop a novel conservative treatment for DDD and related discogenic back pain.
STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The setting of this study is the laboratory investigation.
METHODS: Disc injury was induced in 272 rats via 21-ga needle puncture. After 6 weeks, injured discs were treated with simvastatin in a saline or hydrogel carrier. Rats were sacrificed at predetermined time points. Outcome measures assessed were radiologic, histologic, and genetic. Radiologically, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) index (number of pixels multiplied by the corresponding image densities) was determined. Histologically, disc spaces were read by three blinded scorers using a previously described histologic grading scale. Genetically, nuclei pulposi were harvested, and polymerase chain reaction was run to determine relative levels of aggrecan, collagen type II, and BMP-2 gene expression.
RESULTS: Radiologically, discs treated with 5 mg/mL of simvastatin in hydrogel or saline demonstrated MRI indices that were normal through 8 weeks after treatment, although this was more sustained when delivered in hydrogel. Histologically, discs treated with 5 mg/mL of simvastatin in hydrogel demonstrated improved grades compared with discs treated at higher doses. Genetically, discs treated with 5 mg/mL of simvastatin in hydrogel demonstrated higher gene expression of aggrecan and collagen type II than control.
CONCLUSIONS: Degenerate discs treated with 5 mg/mL of simvastatin in a hydrogel carrier demonstrated radiographic and histologic features resembling normal noninjured IVDs. In addition, the gene expression of aggrecan and collagen type II (important constituents of the IVD extracellular matrix) was upregulated in treated discs. Injection of simvastatin into degenerate IVDs may result in retardation of disc degeneration and represents a promising investigational therapy for conservative treatment of DDD.},

	Abstract = {OBJECT: Tissue-engineered intervertebral discs (TE-IVDs) represent a new experimental approach for the treatment of degenerative disc disease. Compared with mechanical implants, TE-IVDs may better mimic the properties of native discs. The authors conducted a study to evaluate the outcome of TE-IVDs implanted into the rat-tail spine using radiological parameters and histology.
METHODS: Tissue-engineered intervertebral discs consist of a distinct nucleus pulposus (NP) and anulus fibrosus (AF) that are engineered in vitro from sheep IVD chondrocytes. In 10 athymic rats a discectomy in the caudal spine was performed. The discs were replaced with TE-IVDs. Animals were kept alive for 8 months and were killed for histological evaluation. At 1, 5, and 8 months, MR images were obtained; T1-weighted sequences were used for disc height measurements, and T2-weighted sequences were used for morphological analysis. Quantitative T2 relaxation time analysis was used to assess the water content and T1ρ-relaxation time to assess the proteoglycan content of TE-IVDs.
RESULTS: Disc height of the transplanted segments remained constant between 68% and 74% of healthy discs. Examination of TE-IVDs on MR images revealed morphology similar to that of native discs. T2-relaxation time did not differ between implanted and healthy discs, indicating similar water content of the NP tissue. The size of the NP decreased in TE-IVDs. Proteoglycan content in the NP was lower than it was in control discs. Ossification of the implanted segment was not observed. Histological examination revealed an AF consisting of an organized parallel-aligned fiber structure. The NP matrix appeared amorphous and contained cells that resembled chondrocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: The TE-IVDs remained viable over 8 months in vivo and maintained a structure similar to that of native discs. Tissue-engineered intervertebral discs should be explored further as an option for the potential treatment of degenerative disc disease.},

	Abstract = {To establish a minimally invasive rat model of lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) to better understand the pathophysiology of the human condition. The annulus fibrosus of lumbar level 4-5 (L4-5) and L5-6 discs were punctured by 27-gauge needles using the posterior approach under C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological examination by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were performed at baseline and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after disc puncture surgery to determine the degree of degeneration. All sixty discs (thirty rats) were punctured successfully. Only two of thirty rats subjected to the procedure exhibited immediate neurological symptoms. The MRI results indicated a gradual increase in Pfirrmann grade from 4 to 8 weeks post-surgery (P<0.05), and H&E staining demonstrated a parallel increase in histological grade (P<0.05). Expression levels of aggrecan, type II collagen (Col2), and Sox9 mRNAs, which encode disc components, decreased gradually post-surgery. In contrast, mRNA expression of type I collagen (Col1), an indicator of fibrosis, increased (P<0.05). The procedure of annular puncture using a 27-gauge needle under C-arm fluoroscopic guidance had a high success rate. Histological, MRI, and RT-PCR results revealed that the rat model of disc degeneration is a progressive pathological process that is similar to human IDD.},

	Abstract = {Spinal cord transection at midthoracic level leads to an immediate loss of hindlimb motor function as well as to a progressive degeneration of descending and ascending spinal cord pathways. Thoracic spinal cord in unlesioned control rats and in rats 2 to 6 months after complete midthoracic transection were imaged in vivo using an ultrahigh-field (4.7 T) magnetic resonance spectrometer. High-resolution spin-echo and inversion-recovery pulse sequences were employed. In addition, the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) in longitudinal and transverse directions of the spinal cord were determined. Anatomical MRI findings were confirmed in histological spinal cord tissue preparations. In healthy spinal cord, gray and white matter were easily discerned in proton density-weighted images. An infield resolution of max. 76 micrometers per pixel was achieved. In animals with chronic spinal cord transection changes in gray-white matter structure and contrast were observed toward the cut end. The spinal cord stumps showed a tapering off. This coincided with changes in the longitudinal/transverse ADC ratio. Fluid-filled cysts were found in most cases at the distal end of the rostral stump. The gap between the stumps contained richly vascularized scar tissue. Additional pathologic changes included intramedullary microcysts, vertebral dislocations, and in one animal compression of the spinal cord. In conclusion, MRI was found to be a useful method for in vivo investigation of anatomical and physiological changes following spinal cord transection and to estimate the degree of neural degeneration. In addition, MRI allows the description of the accurate extension of fluid spaces (e.g., cysts) and of water diffusion characteristics which cannot be achieved by other means in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The ability to perform small animal functional cardiac imaging on clinical MRI scanners may be of particular value in cases in which the availability of a dedicated high field animal MRI scanner is limited. Here, we propose radial MR cardiac imaging in the rat on a whole-body clinical 3 T scanner in combination with interspersed projection navigators for self-gating without any additional external triggering requirements for electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration. Single navigator readouts were interspersed using the same TR and a high navigator frequency of 54 Hz into a radial golden-angle acquisition. The extracted navigator function was thresholded to exclude data for reconstruction from inhalation phases during the breathing cycle, enabling free breathing acquisition. To minimize flow artifacts in the dynamic cine images a center-out half echo radial acquisition scheme with ramp sampling was used. Navigator functions were derived from the corresponding projection navigator data from which both respiration and cardiac cycles were extracted. Self-gated cine acquisition resulted in high-quality cardiac images which were free of major artifacts with spatial resolution of up to 0.21 × 0.21 × 1.00 mm(3) and a contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of 21 $\pm$ 3 between the myocardium and left ventricle. Self-gated golden ratio based radial acquisition successfully acquired cine images of the rat heart on a clinical MRI system without the need for dedicated animal ECG equipment.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To clarify the use of MRI phase contrast (PC), as an alternative to Doppler echocardiography, when measuring high-velocity turbulent jets associated with stenotic valvular disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo PC aortic stroke volume (SV) was compared with ventricular SV in 31 patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS). Two in vitro pipe experiments were conducted to evaluate errors in steady stenotic and nonstenotic turbulent flows.
RESULTS: The average in vivo error in SV was -24% in the left-ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT) and -41% in the aortic root. Errors were most prominent in patients with the highest Doppler peak velocities. In vitro nonstenotic flow experiments showed accurate flow measurement with an average error of 1.8%. Significant errors were found in the in vitro stenotic flow, which reduced with shorter echo times (TE): average error -166/-67/-25/-13/-8.8% for TEs of 4.8/4.0/3.3/2.2/2.0 msec. In both the in vivo and in vitro stenotic experiments the errors were associated with signal loss in the flow-compensated magnitude image.
CONCLUSION: Signal loss is associated with flow errors in stenotic jets. Current clinically available PC pulse sequences with TE >2 msec may not accurately quantify flow for severe lesions.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the applicability of different self-gating (SG) strategies for respiratory SG in cardiac MRI in combination with iteratively reconstructed (k-t SPARSE SENSE) cine data with low and high temporal resolution.
METHODS: Eleven SG variants were compared in five volunteers by assessment of the resulting image sharpness compared with nongated reconstructions. Promising SG techniques were applied for high temporal resolution reconstructions of the heart function.
RESULTS: SG was successful in all volunteers with image-based SG and the ∑||p|| technique. These approaches were also superior to gating from the respiratory bellows signal on average. Combination with k-t SPARSE SENSE enabled high temporally resolved visualization of the heart motion with free breathing.
CONCLUSION: Respiratory SG can be applied for improving image sharpness. Combining SG with iterative reconstruction allows generation of high temporal resolution cine data, which reveal more details of cardiac motion. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a fast protocol for ultra-short echo time (UTE) Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the beating murine heart. The sequence involves a self-gated UTE with golden-angle radial acquisition and compressed sensing reconstruction. The self-gated acquisition is performed asynchronously with the heartbeat, resulting in a randomly undersampled kt-space that facilitates compressed sensing reconstruction. The sequence was tested in 4 healthy rats and 4 rats with chronic myocardial infarction, approximately 2 months after surgery. As a control, a non-accelerated self-gated multi-slice FLASH sequence with an echo time (TE) of 2.76 ms, 4.5 signal averages, a matrix of 192 × 192, and an acquisition time of 2 min 34 s per slice was used to obtain Cine MRI with 15 frames per heartbeat. Non-accelerated UTE MRI was performed with TE = 0.29 ms, a reconstruction matrix of 192 × 192, and an acquisition time of 3 min 47 s per slice for 3.5 averages. Accelerated imaging with 2×, 4× and 5× undersampled kt-space data was performed with 1 min, 30 and 15 s acquisitions, respectively. UTE Cine images up to 5× undersampled kt-space data could be successfully reconstructed using a compressed sensing algorithm. In contrast to the FLASH Cine images, flow artifacts in the UTE images were nearly absent due to the short echo time, simplifying segmentation of the left ventricular (LV) lumen. LV functional parameters derived from the control and the accelerated Cine movies were statistically identical.},

	Abstract = {ECG-gated cardiac MRI in the mouse is hindered by many technical difficulties in ECG signal recording inside high magnetic field scanners. The present study proposes a robust rectilinear method of acquiring cardiac and respiratory self-gated cine images in mouse hearts. In this approach, a motion-synchronization MR signal is collected in the center of k-space simultaneously with imaging data in each readout of a nontriggered rectilinear acquisition. This signal is then used for both cardiac and respiratory retrospective gating before cine image reconstruction. The value of this approach for overcoming ECG-gating failure was demonstrated by performing cardiac imaging in eight mice with myocardial infarction. Comparison with an auto-gated radial k-space sampling technique, previously reported for cardiac applications in the mouse, found the rectilinear strategy more robust, thanks to a more reliable self-gating signal, while the radial strategy was less sensitive to motion and flow artifacts.},

@article{Schulz:2008aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Self-gating (SG) is a method to record cardiac movement during MR imaging. It uses information from an additional short, non-spatially encoded data acquisition. This usually lengthens TE and increases the sensitivity to flow artifacts. A new flow compensation scheme optimized for self-gating sequences is introduced that has very little or no time penalty over self-gating sequences without flow compensation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three variants of a self-gated 2D spoiled gradient echo or fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence were implemented: without (noFC), with a conventional, serial (cFC), and with a new, time-efficient flow compensation (sFC). In experiments on volunteers and small animals, the sequence variants were compared with regard to the SG signal and the flow artifacts in the images.
RESULTS: Both cFC and sFC reduce flow artifacts in cardiac images. The SG signal of the sFC is more sensitive to physiological motion, so that a cardiac trigger can be extracted more precisely as in cFC. In a typical setting for small animal imaging, sFC technique reduces the echo/repetition time over cFC by about 23%/14%.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-gated dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) enables non-invasive visualization of the heart and accurate assessment of cardiac function in mouse models of human disease. However, self-gated CMR requires the acquisition of large datasets to ensure accurate and artifact-free reconstruction of cardiac cines and is therefore hampered by long acquisition times putting high demands on the physiological stability of the animal. For this reason, we evaluated the feasibility of accelerating the data collection using the parallel imaging technique SENSE with respect to both anatomical definition and cardiac function quantification.
RESULTS: Findings obtained from accelerated data sets were compared to fully sampled reference data. Our results revealed only minor differences in image quality of short- and long-axis cardiac cines: small anatomical structures (papillary muscles and the aortic valve) and left-ventricular (LV) remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) were accurately detected even for 3-fold accelerated data acquisition using a four-element phased array coil. Quantitative analysis of LV cardiac function (end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and LV mass) in healthy and infarcted animals revealed no substantial deviations from reference (fully sampled) data for all investigated acceleration factors with deviations ranging from 2% to 6% in healthy animals and from 2% to 8% in infarcted mice for the highest acceleration factor of 3.0. CNR calculations performed between LV myocardial wall and LV cavity revealed a maximum CNR decrease of 50% for the 3-fold accelerated data acquisition when compared to the fully-sampled acquisition.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of accelerated self-gated retrospective CMR in mice using the parallel imaging technique SENSE. The proposed method led to considerably reduced acquisition times, while preserving high spatial resolution at sufficiently high CNR. The accuracy of measurements of both structural and functional parameters of the mouse heart was not compromised by the application of the proposed accelerated data acquisition method.},

	Abstract = {Motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans routinely results in undesirable image artifact or blurring. Since high-resolution, three-dimensional (3D) imaging of the mouse requires long scan times for satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and image quality, motion-related artifacts are likely over much of the body and limit applications of mouse MRI. In this investigation, we explored the use of self-gated imaging methods and image coregistration for improving image quality in the presence of motion. Self-gated signal results from a modified 3D gradient-echo sequence showed detection of periodic respiratory and cardiac motion in the adult mouse-with excellent comparison to traditional measurements, sensitivity to respiration-induced tissue changes in the brain, and even detection of embryonic cardiac motion in utero. Serial image coregistration with rapidly-acquired, low-SNR volumes further enabled detection and correction of bulk changes in embryo location during in utero imaging sessions and subsequent reconstruction of high-quality images. These methods, in combination, are shown to expand the range of applications for 3D mouse MRI, enabling late-stage embryonic heart imaging and introducing the possibility of longitudinal developmental studies from embryonic stages through adulthood.},

	Abstract = {Measurement of cardiac function is often performed in mice after, for example, a myocardial infarction. Cardiac MRI is often used because it is noninvasive and provides high temporal and spatial resolution for the left and right ventricle. In animal cardiac MRI, the quality of the required electrocardiogram signal is variable and sometimes deteriorates over time, especially with infarcted hearts or cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, we compared the self-gated IntraGateFLASH method with a prospectively triggered FLASH (fast low-angle shot) method in mice with myocardial infarcts (n = 16) and in control mice (n = 21). Mice with a myocardial infarct and control mice were imaged in a vertical 9.4-T MR system. Images of contiguous 1-mm slices were acquired from apex to base with prospective and self-gated methods. Data were processed to calculate cardiac function parameters for the left and right ventricle. The signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were calculated in mid-ventricular slices. The signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios of the self-gated data were higher than those of the prospectively gated data. Differences between the two gating methods in the cardiac function parameters for both left and right ventricle (e.g. end-diastolic volumes) did not exceed the inter-observer variability in control or myocardial infarcted mice. Both methods gave comparable results with regard to the cardiac function parameters in both healthy control mice and mice with myocardial infarcts. Moreover, the self-gated method provided better signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios when the acquisition time was equal. In conclusion, the self-gated method is suitable for routine use in cardiac MRI in mice with myocardial infarcts as well as in control mice, and obviates the need for electrocardiogram triggering and respiratory gating. In both gating methods, more than 10 frames per cardiac cycle are recommended.},

	Abstract = {Non-invasive imaging methods like echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are very valuable in longitudinal follow-up studies of cardiac function in small animals. To be able to compare results from studies using different methods, and explain possible differences, it is important to know the agreement between these methods. As both self-gated high-field MRI and high-frequency echocardiography (hf-echo) M-mode are potential methods for evaluation of left ventricular (LV) function in healthy mice, our aim was to assess the agreement between these two methods. Fifteen healthy female C57BL/6J mice underwent both self-gated MRI and hf-echo during the same session of light isoflurane anaesthesia. LV dimensions were estimated offline, and agreement between the methods and reproducibility for the two methods assessed using Bland-Altman methods. In summary, hf-echo M-mode had better inter-observer repeatability than self-gated MRI for all measured parameters. Compared with hf-echo, systolic posterior wall thicknesses were significantly higher when measured by MRI, while diastolic anterior wall thicknesses were found to be significantly smaller. MRI measurements of diastolic LV diameter were also higher using MRI, resulting in larger fractional shortening values compared with the values obtained by hf-echo. In conclusion, hf-echo M-mode is easy to apply, has high temporal and spatial resolution, and good reproducibility. Self-gated MRI might be advantageous in cases of abnormal LV geometry and heterogeneous regional myocardial function, especially with improvements in spatial resolution. The moderate agreement between the methods must be taken into account when comparing studies using the two modalities.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) assessment of infarct size, a comparison with manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI), and histology was performed in a permanent infarction model in the mouse at the acute and chronic stage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a paired fashion at the acute and chronic stage after infarction (3-4 days and 21 days, respectively), LGE and MEMRI was performed using a self-gated fast low flip angle shot (FLASH). Infarct size was evaluated as the enhanced area relative to the complete myocardial wall area in a mid-ventricular slice. Paired comparisons were made between contrast agents and between timepoints, as well as to histology.
RESULTS: At the acute stage, LGE delineated a larger infarct size as compared to both MEMRI and histology. Infarct size from LGE decreased from the acute to chronic stage, a temporal development not seen with MEMRI. At the chronic stage, no significant differences in infarct size were found between the methods.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates an overenhancement of infarct size when using LGE, supported by an initial overestimation at the acute stage and a temporal decrease in infarct size from the acute to chronic stage, as compared to infarct size from MEMRI.},

	Abstract = {Flow jets containing velocities up to 5-7 m/s are common in patients with congenital defects and patients with valvular disease (stenosis and regurgitation). The quantitation of peak velocity and flow volume in these jets is clinically significant but requires specialized imaging sequences. Conventional 2DFT phase contrast sequences require lengthy acquisitions on the order of several minutes. Conventional spiral phase contrast sequences are faster, but are highly corrupted by flow artifacts at these high velocities due to phase dispersion and motion during the excitation and readout. A new prospectively gated method based on spiral phase contrast is presented, which has a sufficiently short measurement interval (<4 ms) to minimize flow artifacts, while achieving high spatial resolution (2 x 2 x 4 mm(3)) to minimize partial volume effects, all within a single breathhold. A complete single-slice phase contrast movie loop with 22 ms true temporal resolution is acquired in one 10-heartbeat breathhold. Simulations indicate that this technique is capable of imaging through-plane jets with velocities up to 10 m/s, and initial studies in aortic stenosis patients show accurate in vivo measurement of peak velocities up to 4.2 m/s (using echocardiography as a reference).},

In this study, the authors set out to derive both spatial and temporal components of acceleration, and hence differences of pressure in a flow field using cine magnetic resonance velocity data. An efficient numerical algorithm based on the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible Newtonian fluid was used. The computational approach was validated with in vitro flow phantoms. This work aims to contribute to a better understanding of cardiovascular dynamics and to serve as a basis for investigating pulsatile pressure/flow relationships associated with normal and impaired cardiovascular function.},

@article{Amirbekian:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) localize in the infrarenal aorta in humans, while they are found in the suprarenal aorta in mouse models. It has been shown previously that humans experience a reversal of flow during early diastole in the infrarenal aorta during each cardiac cycle. This flow reversal causes oscillatory wall shear stress (OWSS) to be present in the infrarenal aorta of humans. OWSS has been linked to a variety of proatherogenic and proinflammatory factors. The presence of reverse flow in the mouse aorta is unknown. In this study we investigated blood flow in mice, using phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) imaging. We measured blood flow in the suprarenal and infrarenal abdominal aorta of 18 wild-type C57BL/6J mice and 15 apolipoprotein E (apoE)-/- mice. Although OWSS was not directly evaluated, results indicate that, unlike humans, there is no reversal of flow in the infrarenal aorta of wild-type or apoE-/- mice. Distensibility of the mouse aortic wall in both the suprarenal and infrarenal segments is higher than reported values for the human aorta. We conclude that normal mice do not experience the reverse flow in the infrarenal aorta that is observed in humans.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The beating heart is the generator of blood flow through the cardiovascular system. Within the heart's own chambers, normal complex blood flow patterns can be disturbed by diseases. Methods for the quantification of intra-cardiac blood flow, with its 4D (3D+time) nature, are lacking. We sought to develop and validate a novel semi-automatic analysis approach that integrates flow and morphological data.
METHOD: In six healthy subjects and three patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, three-directional, three-dimensional cine phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) velocity data and balanced steady-state free-precession long- and short-axis images were acquired. The LV endocardium was segmented from the short-axis images at the times of isovolumetric contraction (IVC) and isovolumetric relaxation (IVR). At the time of IVC, pathlines were emitted from the IVC LV blood volume and traced forwards and backwards in time until IVR, thus including the entire cardiac cycle. The IVR volume was used to determine if and where the pathlines left the LV. This information was used to automatically separate the pathlines into four different components of flow: Direct Flow, Retained Inflow, Delayed Ejection Flow and Residual Volume. Blood volumes were calculated for every component by multiplying the number of pathlines with the blood volume represented by each pathline. The accuracy and inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the approach were evaluated by analyzing volumes of LV inflow and outflow, the four flow components, and the end-diastolic volume.
RESULTS: The volume and distribution of the LV flow components were determined in all subjects. The calculated LV outflow volumes [ml] (67 +/- 13) appeared to fall in between those obtained by through-plane phase-contrast CMR (77 +/- 16) and Doppler ultrasound (58 +/- 10), respectively. Calculated volumes of LV inflow (68 +/- 11) and outflow (67 +/- 13) were well matched (NS). Low inter- and intra-observer variability for the assessment of the volumes of the flow components was obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: This semi-automatic analysis approach for the quantification of 4D blood flow resulted in accurate LV inflow and outflow volumes and a high reproducibility for the assessment of LV flow components.},

	Abstract = {Intracardiac blood flow patterns are potentially important to cardiac pumping efficiency. However, these complex flow patterns remain incompletely characterized both in health and disease. We hypothesized that normal left ventricular (LV) blood flow patterns would preferentially optimize a portion of the end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) for effective and rapid systolic ejection by virtue of location near and motion towards the LV outflow tract (LVOT). Three-dimensional cine velocity and morphological data were acquired in 12 healthy persons and 1 patient with dilated cardiomyopathy using MRI. A previously validated method was used for analysis in which the LVEDV was separated into four functional flow components based on the blood's locations at the beginning and end of the cardiac cycle. Each component's volume, kinetic energy (KE), site, direction, and linear momentum relative to the LVOT were calculated. Of the four components, the LV inflow that passes directly to outflow in a single cardiac cycle (Direct Flow) had the largest volume. At the time of isovolumic contraction, Direct Flow had the greatest amount of KE and the most favorable combination of distance, angle, and linear momentum relative to the LVOT. Atrial contraction boosted the late diastolic KE of the ejected components. We conclude that normal diastolic LV flow creates favorable conditions for ensuing ejection, defined by proximity and energetics, for the Direct Flow, and that atrial contraction augments the end-diastolic KE of the ejection volume. The correlation of Direct Flow characteristics with ejection efficiency might be a relevant investigative target in cardiac failure.},

@article{Eriksson:2013aa,
	Abstract = {AIMS: Patients with mild heart failure (HF) who are clinically compensated may have normal left ventricular (LV) stroke volume (SV). Despite this, altered intra-ventricular flow patterns have been recognized in these subjects. We hypothesized that, compared with normal LVs, flow in myopathic LVs would demonstrate a smaller proportion of inflow volume passing directly to ejection and diminished the end-diastolic preservation of the inflow kinetic energy (KE).
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 10 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (49 $\pm$ 14 years, six females) and 10 healthy subjects (44 $\pm$ 17 years, four females), four-dimensional MRI velocity and morphological data were acquired. A previously validated method was used to separate the LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) into four flow components based on the blood's locations at the beginning and end of the cardiac cycle. KE was calculated over the cardiac cycle for each component. The EDV was larger (P = 0.021) and the ejection fraction smaller (P < 0.001) in DCM compared with healthy subjects; the SV was equivalent (DCM: 77 $\pm$ 19, healthy: 79 $\pm$ 16 mL). The proportion of the total LV inflow that passed directly to ejection was smaller in DCM (P = 0.000), but the end-diastolic KE/mL of the direct flow was not different in the two groups (NS).
CONCLUSION: Despite equivalent LVSVs, HF patients with mild LV remodelling demonstrate altered diastolic flow routes through the LV and impaired preservation of inflow KE at pre-systole compared with healthy subjects. These unique flow-specific changes in the flow route and energetics are detectable despite clinical compensation, and may prove useful as subclinical markers of LV dysfunction.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-contrast weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) allows detailed plaque characterisation and assessment of plaque vulnerability. The aim of this preliminary study was to show the potential of Ultra-short Echo Time (UTE) subtraction MR in detecting calcification.
METHODS: 14 ex-vivo human carotid arteries were scanned using CMR and CT, prior to histological slide preparation. Two images were acquired using a double-echo 3D UTE pulse, one with a long TE and the second with an ultra-short TE, with the same TR. An UTE subtraction (DeltaUTE) image containing only ultra-short T2 (and T2*) signals was obtained by post-processing subtraction of the 2 UTE images. The DeltaUTE image was compared to the conventional 3D T1-weighted sequence and CT scan of the carotid arteries.
RESULTS: In atheromatous carotid arteries, there was a 71% agreement between the high signal intensity areas on DeltaUTE images and CT scan. The same areas were represented as low signal intensity on T1W and areas of void on histology, indicating focal calcification. However, in 15% of all the scans there were some incongruent regions of high intensity on DeltaUTE that did not correspond with a high intensity signal on CT, and histology confirmed the absence of calcification.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that the UTE sequence has potential to identify calcified plaque. Further work is needed to fully understand the UTE findings.},

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional phase-contrast velocity vector field mapping shows great potential for clinical applications; however measurement inaccuracies may limit the utility and robustness of the technique. While parts of the error in the measured velocity fields can be minimized by background phase estimation in static tissue and magnetic field monitoring, considerable inaccuracies remain. The present work introduces divergence-reduction processing of 3D phase-contrast flow data based on a synergistic combination of normalized convolution and divergence-free radial basis functions. It is demonstrated that this approach effectively addresses erroneous flow for image reconstructions from both fully sampled and undersampled data. Using computer simulations and in vivo data acquired in the aorta of healthy subjects and a stenotic valve patient it is shown that divergence arising from measurement imperfections can be reduced by up to 87% resulting in improved vector field representations. Based on the results obtained it is concluded that integration of the divergence-free condition into postprocessing of vector fields presents an efficient approach to addressing flow field inaccuracies.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate an effective time-resolved variable-density random undersampling scheme combined with an efficient parallel image reconstruction method for highly accelerated aortic 4D flow MR imaging with high reconstruction accuracy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Variable-density Poisson-disk sampling (vPDS) was applied in both the phase-slice encoding plane and the temporal domain to accelerate the time-resolved 3D Cartesian acquisition of flow imaging. In order to generate an improved initial solution for the iterative self-consistent parallel imaging method (SPIRiT), a sample-selective view sharing reconstruction for time-resolved random undersampling (STIRRUP) was introduced. The performance of different undersampling and image reconstruction schemes were evaluated by retrospectively applying those to fully sampled data sets obtained from three healthy subjects and a flow phantom.
RESULTS: Undersampling pattern based on the combination of time-resolved vPDS, the temporal sharing scheme STIRRUP, and parallel imaging SPIRiT, were able to achieve 6-fold accelerated 4D flow MRI with high accuracy using a small number of coils (N=5). The normalized root mean square error between aorta flow waveforms obtained with the acceleration method and the fully sampled data in three healthy subjects was 0.04$\pm$0.02, and the difference in peak-systolic mean velocity was -0.29$\pm$2.56cm/s.
CONCLUSION: Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of our preliminary results demonstrate that time-resolved variable-density random sampling is efficient for highly accelerating 4D flow imaging while maintaining image reconstruction accuracy.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To test the feasibility of velocity distribution analysis for identifying altered three-dimensional (3D) flow characteristics in patients with aortic disease based on 4D flow MRI volumetric analysis.
METHODS: Forty patients with aortic (Ao) dilation (mid ascending aortic diameter MAA = 40 $\pm$ 7 mm, age = 56 $\pm$ 17 years, 11 females) underwent cardiovascular MRI. Four groups were retrospectively defined: mild Ao dilation (n = 10; MAA < 35 mm); moderate Ao dilation (n = 10; 35 < MAA < 45 mm); severe Ao dilation (n = 10; MAA > 45 mm); Ao dilation+aortic stenosis AS (n = 10; MAA > 35 mm and peak velocity > 2.5 m/s). The 3D PC-MR angiograms were computed and used to obtain a 3D segmentation of the aorta which was divided into four segments: root, ascending aorta, arch, descending aorta. Radial chart displays were used to visualize multiple parameters representing segmental changes in the 3D velocity distribution associated with aortic disease.
RESULTS: Changes in the velocity field and geometry between cohorts resulted in distinct hemodynamic patterns for each aortic segment. Disease progression from mild to Ao dilation + AS resulted in significant differences (P < 0.05) in flow parameters across cohorts and increased radial chart size for root and ascending aorta segments by 146% and 99%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Volumetric 4D velocity distribution analysis has the potential to identify characteristic changes in regional blood flow patterns in patients with aortic disease. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have investigated histological staining compounds as micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) contrast agents, delivered by soaking tissue specimens in stain and relying on passive diffusion for agent uptake. This study describes a perfusion approach using iodine or phosphotungstic acid (PTA) stains, delivered to an intact mouse, to capitalize on the microvasculature as a delivery conduit for parenchymal staining and direct contact for staining artery walls. Twelve C57BL/6 mice, arterially perfused with either 25% Lugol's solution or 5% PTA solution were scanned intact and reconstructed with 26 µm isotropic voxels. The animals were fixed and the heart and surrounding vessels were excised, embedded and scanned; isolated heart images were reconstructed with 13 µm isotropic voxels. Myocardial enhancement and artery diameters were measured. Both stains successfully enhanced the myocardium and vessel walls. Interestingly, Lugol's solution provided a significantly higher enhancement of the myocardium than PTA [2502 $\pm$ 437 vs 656 $\pm$ 178 Hounsfield units (HU); p < 0.0001], delineating myofiber architecture and orientation. There was no significant difference in vessel wall enhancement (Lugol's, 1036 $\pm$ 635 HU; PTA, 738 $\pm$ 124 HU; p = 0.29), but coronary arteries were more effectively segmented from the PTA-stained hearts, enabling segmented imaging of fifth- order coronary artery branches. The combination of whole mouse perfusion delivery and use of heavy metal-containing stains affords high-resolution imaging of the mouse heart and vasculature by micro-CT. The differential imaging patterns of Lugol's- and PTA-stained tissues reveals new opportunities for micro-analyses of cardiac and vascular tissues.

	Abstract = {Phase contrast (PC) magnetic resonance imaging with a three-dimensional, radially undersampled acquisition allows for the acquisition of high resolution angiograms and velocimetry in dramatically reduced scan times. However, such an acquisition is sensitive to blurring and artifacts from off-resonance and trajectory errors. A dual-echo trajectory is proposed with a novel trajectory calibration from prescan data coupled with a multi-frequency reconstruction to correct for these errors. Comparisons of phantom data and in vivo results from volunteer, and patients with arteriovenous malformations patients are presented with and without these corrections and show significant improvement of image quality when both corrections are applied. The results demonstrate significantly improved visualization of vessels, allowing for highly accelerated PC acquisitions without sacrifice in image quality.},

	Abstract = {Regional myocardial function is a complex entity consisting of motion in three dimensions (3D). Besides magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), no other noninvasive technique can give a true 3D description of cardiac motion. Using a time-resolved 3D phase contrast technique, three-dimensional image volumes containing myocardial velocity data in six normal volunteers were acquired. Coordinates and velocity information were extracted from nine points placed in different myocardial segments in the left ventricle (LV), and decomposed into longitudinal (V(L)), radial (V(R)), and circumferential (V(C)) velocity components. Our findings confirm a longitudinal apex-to-base gradient for the LV, with only a small motion of the apex. The mean velocity for V(L) for all the basal segments was higher compared to the midsegments during systole [3.5+/-1.2 vs. 2.5+/-1.7 cm/s (p<0.01)], early filling [-6.9+/-1.8 vs. -4.9+/-1.8 cm/s (p<0.001)], and during atrial contraction [-2.2+/-1.4 vs. -1.6+/-1.3 cm/s (p<0.05)]. A similar pattern was observed when comparing velocities from the midsegments to the apex. Radial velocity was higher during early filling in the midportion of the lateral [-4.9+/-2.7 vs. -3.2+/-1.6 cm/s (p<0.05)] wall compared to the basal segments, no difference was observed for the septal [-2.0+/-1.5 vs. -0.3+/-2.5 cm/s (p=0.15)], anterior [-5.8+/-3.3 vs. -4.0+/-1.7 cm/s (p=0.17)], and posterior [-2.3+/-2.1 vs. -2.5+/-1.0 cm/s (p=0.78)] walls. When observing the myocardial velocity in a single point and visualizing the movement of the main direction of the velocities in this point as vectors in velocity vector plots like planes, it is clear that myocardial movement is by no means one dimensional. In conclusion, our time-resolved 3D, phase contrast MRI technique makes it feasible to extract myocardial velocities from anywhere in the myocardium, including all three velocity components without the need for positioning any slices at the time of acquisition.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Three-dimensional phase-contrast (3DPC) is limited by long imaging times, limited coverage, flow artifacts, and the need to perform multiple additional 2D examinations (2DPC) to measure flow. A highly undersampled 3D radial acquisition (isotropic-voxel radial projection imaging [PCVIPR]) makes it possible to increase the product of volume coverage and spatial resolution by a factor of 30 for the same imaging time as conventional Cartesian 3DPC. This provides anatomic information over a large volume with high isotropic resolution and permits retrospective measurement of average flow rates throughout the volume.
METHODS: PCVIPR acquires a reference and three flow-encoded acquisitions for each VIPR projection. Complex difference images were formed by combining information from all flow directions. Following retrospective definition of planes perpendicular to selected vessels, volume flow rates were determined by using phase-difference information. The accuracy of average flow measurement was investigated in a phantom and in six volunteers. Anatomic PCVIPR images acquired in three patients and three volunteers by using a 384(3) matrix were compared with conventional Cartesian 3DPC.
RESULTS: The flow validation produced R2 = 0.99 in vitro and R2 = 0.97 in vivo. PCVIPR produced minimal streak and pulsatile flow artifacts. PCVIPR produced far higher resolution and volume coverage in comparable imaging times. The highest acceleration factors relative to 3DPC were achieved by using gadolinium-contrast material. Ultimately, acceleration factors are limited by signal-to-noise ratio.
CONCLUSION: PCVIPR rapidly provides isotropic high-resolution angiographic images and permits retrospective measurement of average flow rate throughout the volume without the need to prescribe multiple 2D acquisition planes.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate whether an existing method for correction of phase offset errors in phase-contrast velocity quantification is applicable for assessment of main pulmonary artery flow with an MR scanner equipped with a high-power gradient system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The correction method consists of fitting a surface through the time average of stationary pixels of velocity-encoded phase images, and subtracting this surface from the velocity images. Pixels are regarded as stationary if their time standard deviation falls into the lowest percentile. Flow was measured in the main pulmonary artery of 15 subjects. Each measurement was repeated on a stationary phantom. The phase offset error in the phantom was used as a reference. Correction was applied with varying polynomial surface orders (0-5) and stationarity percentiles (5-50%). The optimal surface order and stationarity percentile were determined by comparing the fitted surface with the phantom.
RESULTS: Using a first-order surface and a (noncritical) 25% percentile, the correction method significantly reduced the phase offset error from 1.1 to 0.35 cm/second (RMS), which is equivalent to a reduction from 11% to 3.3% of mean volume flow. Phase error correction strongly affected stroke volume (range -11 to 26%).
CONCLUSION: The method significantly reduces phase offset errors in pulmonary artery flow.},

@article{Chernobelsky:2007aa,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Phase-contrast Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) generally requires the analysis of stationary tissue adjacent to a blood vessel to serve as a baseline reference for zero velocity. However, for the heart and great vessels, there is often no stationary tissue immediately adjacent to the vessel. Consequently, uncorrected velocity offsets may introduce substantial errors in flow quantification. The purpose of this study was to assess the magnitude of these flow errors and to validate a clinically applicable method for their correction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 10 normal volunteers, phase-contrast CMR was used to quantify blood flow in the main pulmonary artery (Qp) and the aorta (Qs). Following image acquisition, phase contrast CMR was performed on a stationary phantom using identical acquisition parameters so as to provide a baseline reference for zero velocity. Aortic and pulmonary blood flow was then corrected using the offset values from the phantom.
RESULTS: The mean difference between pulmonary and aortic flow was 26 +/- 21 mL before correction and 7.1 +/- 6.6 mL after correction (p = 0.002). The measured Qp/Qs was 1.25 +/- 0.20 before correction and 1.05 +/- 0.07 after correction (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Phase-contrast CMR can have substantial errors in great vessel flow quantification if there is no correction for velocity offset errors. The proposed method of correction is clinically applicable and provides a more accurate measurement of blood flow.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The measurement of velocities based on phase contrast MRI can be subject to different phase offset errors which can affect the accuracy of velocity data. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of these inaccuracies and to evaluate different correction strategies on three-dimensional visualization.
METHODS: Phase contrast MRI was performed on a 3 T system (Siemens Trio) for in vitro (curved/straight tube models; venc: 0.3 m/s) and in vivo (aorta/intracranial vasculature; venc: 1.5/0.4 m/s) data. For comparison of the impact of different magnetic field gradient designs, in vitro data was additionally acquired on a wide bore 1.5 T system (Siemens Espree). Different correction methods were applied to correct for eddy currents, Maxwell terms, and gradient field inhomogeneities.
RESULTS: The application of phase offset correction methods lead to an improvement of three-dimensional particle trace visualization and count. The most pronounced differences were found for in vivo/in vitro data (68%/82% more particle traces) acquired with a low venc (0.3 m/s/0.4 m/s, respectively). In vivo data acquired with high venc (1.5 m/s) showed noticeable but only minor improvement.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the correction of phase offset errors can be important for a more reliable visualization of particle traces but is strongly dependent on the velocity sensitivity, object geometry, and gradient coil design.},

@article{Markl:2003aa,
	Abstract = {To characterize gradient field nonuniformity and its effect on velocity encoding in phase contrast (PC) MRI, a generalized model that describes this phenomenon and enables the accurate reconstruction of velocities is presented. In addition to considerable geometric distortions, inhomogeneous gradient fields can introduce deviations from the nominal gradient strength and orientation, and therefore spatially-dependent first gradient moments. Resulting errors in the measured phase shifts used for velocity encoding can therefore cause significant deviations in velocity quantification. The true magnitude and direction of the underlying velocities can be recovered from the phase difference images by a generalized PC velocity reconstruction, which requires the acquisition of full three-directional velocity information. The generalized reconstruction of velocities is applied using a matrix formalism that includes relative gradient field deviations derived from a theoretical model of local gradient field nonuniformity. In addition, an approximate solution for the correction of one-directional velocity encoding is given. Depending on the spatial location of the velocity measurements, errors in velocity magnitude can be as high as 60%, while errors in the velocity encoding direction can be up to 45 degrees. Results of phantom measurements demonstrate that effects of gradient field nonuniformity on PC-MRI can be corrected with the proposed method.},

	Abstract = {Background phase distortion and random noise can adversely affect the quality of magnetic resonance (MR) phase velocity measurements. A semiautomated method has been developed that substantially reduces both effects. To remove the background phase distortion, the following steps were taken: The time standard deviations of the phase velocity images over a cardiac cycle were calculated. Static regions were identified as those in which the standard deviation was low. A flat surface representing an approximation to the background distortion was fitted to the static regions and subtracted from the phase velocity images to give corrected phase images. Random noise was removed by setting to zero those regions in which the standard deviation was high. The technique is demonstrated with a sample set of data in which the in-plane velocities have been measured in an imaging section showing the left ventricular outflow tract of a human left ventricle. The results are presented in vector and contour form, superimposed on the conventional MR angiographic images.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important tool for the clinical evaluation of patients with cardiovascular disease. Since its introduction in the late 1980s, 2-dimensional phase contrast MRI (2D PC-MRI) has become a routine part of standard-of-care cardiac MRI for the assessment of regional blood flow in the heart and great vessels. More recently, time-resolved PC-MRI with velocity encoding along all three flow directions and three-dimensional (3D) anatomic coverage (also termed '4D flow MRI') has been developed and applied for the evaluation of cardiovascular hemodynamics in multiple regions of the human body. 4D flow MRI allows for the comprehensive evaluation of complex blood flow patterns by 3D blood flow visualization and flexible retrospective quantification of flow parameters. Recent technical developments, including the utilization of advanced parallel imaging techniques such as k-t GRAPPA, have resulted in reasonable overall scan times, e.g., 8-12 minutes for 4D flow MRI of the aorta and 10-20 minutes for whole heart coverage. As a result, the application of 4D flow MRI in a clinical setting has become more feasible, as documented by an increased number of recent reports on the utility of the technique for the assessment of cardiac and vascular hemodynamics in patient studies. A number of studies have demonstrated the potential of 4D flow MRI to provide an improved assessment of hemodynamics which might aid in the diagnosis and therapeutic management of cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this review is to describe the methods used for 4D flow MRI acquisition, post-processing and data analysis. In addition, the article provides an overview of the clinical applications of 4D flow MRI and includes a review of applications in the heart, thoracic aorta and hepatic system.},

	Abstract = {Several approaches for the non-invasive MRI-based measurement of the aortic pressure waveform over the heart cycle have been proposed in the last years. These methods are normally based on time-resolved, two-dimensional phase-contrast sequences with uni-directionally encoded velocities (2D PC-MRI). In contrast, three-dimensional acquisitions with tridirectional velocity encoding (4D PC-MRI) have been shown to be a suitable data source for detailed investigations of blood flow and spatial blood pressure maps. In order to avoid additional MR acquisitions, it would be advantageous if the aortic pressure waveform could also be computed from this particular form of MRI. Therefore, we propose an approach for the computation of the aortic pressure waveform which can be completely performed using 4D PC-MRI. After the application of a segmentation algorithm, the approach automatically computes the aortic pressure waveform without any manual steps. We show that our method agrees well with catheter measurements in an experimental phantom setup and produces physiologically realistic results in three healthy volunteers.},

	Abstract = {MR microscopy has enormous potential for small-animal cardiac imaging because it is capable of producing volumetric images at multiple time points to accurately measure cardiac function. MR has not been used as frequently as ultrasound to measure cardiac function in the small animal because the MR methods required relatively long scan times, limiting throughput. Here, we demonstrate four-dimensional radial acquisition in conjunction with a liposomal blood pool agent to explore functional differences in three populations of mice: six C57BL/6J mice, six DBA/2J mice, and six DBA/2J CSQ+ mice, all with the same gestational age and approximately the same weight. Cardiovascular function was determined by measuring both left ventricular and right ventricular end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, stroke volume, and ejection fraction. Statistical significance was observed in end diastolic volume, end systolic volume, and ejection fraction for left ventricular measurements between all three populations of mice. No statistically significant difference was observed in stroke volume in either the left or right ventricle for any of the three populations of mice. This study shows that MRI is capable of efficient, high-throughput, four-dimensional cardiovascular phenotyping of the mouse.},

High-resolution 2D cardiac cine MRI has often been used to quantify left and right ventricular function. In this study we propose a 3D isotropic cardiac cine MRI protocol with a voxel size of 200 microm(3) as a means of studying cardiac multi-chamber morphology and function. A black blood sequence was used to enhance blood myocardium contrast. Manual segmentation of the ventricles was used to measure ventricular volumes at end diastole and end systole. This method is demonstrated on an Irx4-deficient mouse model. We have been able to identify the volumes of both ventricles dynamically and to show differences in ejection fraction in the mutant. We have also identified an abnormality of the papillary muscle in the mutant that had been missed in previous phenotyping with ultrasound and histology.},

	Abstract = {Phase-contrast (PC) MRI is a non-invasive technique to assess cardiovascular blood flow. However, this technique is not accurate for instance at the carotid bifurcation due to turbulent and disturbed blood flow in atherosclerotic disease. Flow quantification using conventional PC MRI distal to stenotic vessels suffers from intravoxel dephasing and flow artifacts. Previous studies have shown that short echo time (TE) potentially decreases the phase errors. In this work, a novel 3D cine UTE-PC imaging method is designed to measure the blood velocity in the carotid bifurcation using a UTE center-out radial trajectory and short TE time compared to standard PC MRI sequences. With a new phase error correction technique based on autocorrelation method, the proposed 3D cine UTE-PC has the potential to achieve high accuracy for quantification and visualization of velocity jet distal to a stenosis. Herein, we test the feasibility of the method in determining accurate flow waveforms in normal volunteers.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: : To evaluate the performance of a gadolinium-based contrast compound (P846) as well as an ultra-small particle of iron oxide agent (P904) in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in rabbits and to compare those agents with gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA) for first pass and steady state imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: : A total of 6 rabbits underwent contrast-enhanced MRA of the aorta and its branches at 3 different time points. All examinations were performed on a 1.5T MR (Siemens HealthCare, Magnetom Espree), and the contrast agents were applied in random order. Image data were acquired using a time-resolved MRA sequence (time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories) during the first pass to assess the bolus phase and a high-resolution MRA sequence followed by repetitive measurements over the next 10 minutes for all 3 agents to evaluate the postbolus phase. Two radiologists reviewed the images in consensus blinded to the contrast agent used. Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio for three-dimensional high-resolution MRA were calculated for each time point and agent. Image quality was consensually evaluated on a 4-point Likert scale. A Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison with P < 0.05 as level of statistical significance.
RESULTS: : All agents led to diagnostic MR angiograms in all 6 rabbits. The time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories datasets provided detailed information about the bolus phase for all the 3 agents. During the first pass, P904 and P846 proved to be superior to Gd-DOTA with the highest peak enhancement for P846. In the postbolus phase up to 10 minutes postcontrast injection, P904 proved to be superior to the other agents. All the agents led to excellent image quality, with no statistical difference to a maximum of 3 minutes postinjection, whereas thereafter images with Gd-DOTA and P846 were assessed as nondiagnostic.
CONCLUSIONS: : P846 and P904 proved to be superior to Gd-DOTA for time-resolved MRA. The ultra-small particle of iron oxide compound P904 showed continuous high signal over 10 minutes and seems to be best suited for first pass and steady-state imaging.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of a recently developed fast-clearing ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) for detection of vascular inflammation in atherosclerotic plaque.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee. A recently introduced USPIO, P904, and a reference-standard USPIO, ferumoxtran-10, were tested in a rabbit model of induced aortic atherosclerosis. In vivo magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and T2*-weighted plaque MR imaging were performed at baseline and after administration of P904 and ferumoxtran-10 (administered dose for both, 1000 micromol of iron per kilogram of body weight) in 26 hyperlipidemic New Zealand white rabbits. The variation in vessel wall area over time was evaluated with nonparametric testing. Ex vivo MR imaging findings were compared with iron content at linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: With in vivo MR imaging, plaque analysis was possible as early as 24 hours after P904 injection. The authors observed a 27.75% increase in vessel wall area due to susceptibility artifacts on day 2 (P = .04) and a 38.81% increase on day 3 (P = .04) after P904 administration compared with a 44.5% increase in vessel wall area on day 7 (P = .04) and a 34.8% increase on day 10 (P = .22) after ferumoxtran-10 administration. These susceptibility artifacts were correlated with intraplaque iron uptake in the corresponding histologic slices. The number of pixels with signal loss on the ex vivo MR images was linearly correlated with the logarithm of the iron concentration (P = .0001; R(2) = 0.93).
CONCLUSION: Plaque inflammation in rabbits can be detected earlier with P904 than with ferumoxtran-10 owing to the faster blood pharmacokinetics and the early uptake of P904 in the reticuloendothelial system.

CONCLUSION: Blood pool MR angiography using Ferumoxytol reveals more aortic stent-graft endoleaks than does CT angiography and depicts more endoleaks 24 hr after administration than during the immediate arterial phase because of a 50-fold increase in the volume of enhancement in the aneurysmal sac outside the stent-graft.},

@article{Thornhill:2010aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: rtPA is an effective treatment for AIS, yet it is substantially underused due to the increased risk of HT. Recent work suggests that permeability-related information can be extracted from routine T2*-based perfusion images by measuring the rR of the contrast agent. Given that other T2*-based measures have recently been proposed, the purpose of this study was to evaluate 4 such permeability measures in identifying patients with AIS who will proceed to HT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with AIS were examined within a mean of 3.3 +/- 1.4 hours postonset. Dynamic T2*-weighted imaging consisted of a single-shot EPI following a bolus of gadodiamide. HT was determined on follow-up CT or MR imaging at 24-72 hours. Mean values of rR, Peak Height, Recovery, as well as Slope were calculated and analyzed on the basis of follow-up HT status.
RESULTS: Eight patients proceeded to HT. The mean rR for patients with HT was significantly greater than that for patients without HT (0.22 +/- 0.06 versus 0.14 +/- 0.06, P = .006), while there was a trend toward decreased %Recovery in patients with HT (76 +/- 6 versus 82 +/- 11%, P = .092). There was a significant negative correlation between %Recovery and rR (r = -0.88, P < .001). No significant differences or trends were detected with respect to Peak Height or Slope.
CONCLUSIONS: Both rR and %Recovery can be readily extracted from a routine perfusion MR imaging dataset and show potential for identifying HT during the acute phase poststroke.},

	Abstract = {The application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to non-invasively assess disease biomarkers has been hampered by the lack of desired contrast agents with high relaxivity, targeting capability, and optimized pharmacokinetics. We have developed a novel MR imaging probe targeting to HER2, a biomarker for various cancer types and a drug target for anti-cancer therapies. This multimodal HER20targeted MR imaging probe integrates a de novo designed protein contrast agent with a high affinity HER2 affibody and a near IR fluorescent dye. Our probe can differentially monitor tumors with different expression levels of HER2 in both human cell lines and xenograft mice models. In addition to its 100-fold higher dose efficiency compared to clinically approved non-targeting contrast agent DTPA, our developed agent also exhibits advantages in crossing the endothelial boundary, tissue distribution, and tumor tissue retention over reported contrast agents as demonstrated by even distribution of the imaging probe across the entire tumor mass. This contrast agent will provide a powerful tool for quantitative assessment of molecular markers, and improved resolution for diagnosis, prognosis and drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {A biocompatible, dextran coated superparamagnetic iron oxide particle was derivatized with a peptide sequence from the HIV-tat protein to improve intracellular magnetic labeling of different target cells. The conjugate had a mean particle size of 41 nm and contained an average of 6.7 tat peptides. Derivatized particles were internalized into lymphocytes over 100-fold more efficiently than nonmodified particles, resulting in up to 12.7 x 10(6) particles/cell. Internalized particles localized in cytoplasm and nuclear compartments as demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Labeled cells were highly magnetic, were detectable by NMR imaging, and could be retained on magnetic separation columns. The described method has potential applications for in vivo tracking of magnetically labeled cells by MR imaging and for recovering intracellularly labeled cells from organs.},

They are useful as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents to evaluate: areas of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction related to tumors and other neuroinflammatory pathologies, the cerebrovasculature using perfusion-weighted MRI sequences, and in vivo cellular tracking in CNS disease or injury. Novel, targeted, nanoparticle synthesis strategies will allow for a rapidly expanding range of applications in patients with brain tumors, cerebral ischemia or stroke, carotid atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. These strategies may ultimately improve disease detection, therapeutic monitoring, and treatment efficacy especially in the context of antiangiogenic chemotherapy and antiinflammatory medications. The purpose of this review is to outline the current status of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the context of biomedical nanotechnology as they apply to diagnostic MRI and potential therapeutic applications in neurooncology and other CNS inflammatory conditions.},

	Abstract = {Advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of disease susceptibility coupled with prominent successes for molecular targeted therapies have resulted in an emerging strategy of personalized medicine. This approach envisions risk stratification and therapeutic selection based on an individual's genetic makeup and physiologic state (the latter assessed through cellular or molecular phenotypes). Molecularly targeted nanoparticles can play a key role in this vision through noninvasive assessments of molecular processes and specific cell populations in vivo, sensitive molecular diagnostics, and targeted delivery of therapeutics. A superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle with a cross-linked dextran coating, or CLIO, is a powerful and illustrative nanoparticle platform for these applications. These structures and their derivatives support diagnostic imaging by magnetic resonance (MRI), optical, and positron emission tomography (PET) modalities and constitute a versatile platform for conjugation to targeting ligands. A variety of conjugation methods exist to couple the dextran surface to different functional groups; in addition, a robust bioorthogonal [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between 1,2,4,5-tetrazene (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) can conjugate nanoparticles to targeting ligands or label pretargeted cells. The ready availability of conjugation methods has given rise to the synthesis of libraries of small molecule modified nanoparticles, which can then be screened for nanoparticles with specificity for a specific cell type. Since most nanoparticles display their targeting ligands in a multivalent manner, a detailed understanding of the kinetics and affinity of a nanoparticle's interaction with its target (as determined by surface plasmon resonance) can yield functionally important insights into nanoparticle design. In this Account, we review applications of the CLIO platform in several areas relevant to the mission of personalized medicine. We demonstrate rapid and highly sensitive molecular profiling of cancer markers ex vivo, as part of detailed, individualized molecular phenotyping. The CLIO platform also facilitates targeted magnetic resonance and combined modality imaging (such as MR/PET/fluorescence/CT) to enable multiplexed measurement of molecular phenotypes in vivo for early diagnosis and disease classification. Finally, the targeted delivery of a photodynamic therapy agent as part of a theranostic nanoparticle successfully increased local cell toxicity and minimized systemic side effects.},

	Abstract = {Gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agents (GBCAs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used in daily clinical practice and appear safe in most patients; however, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a recently recognized severe complication associated with GBCAs. It affects primarily patients with renal disease, such as stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD; glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), acute kidney injury, or kidney and liver transplant recipients with kidney dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced MRI and computed tomography (CT) scans provide important clinical information and influence patient management. An alternative contrast agent is needed to obtain adequate imaging results while avoiding the risk of NSF in this vulnerable patient group. One potential alternative is ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles, which provide enhancement characteristics similar to GBCAs. We review our experience in approximately 150 patients on the potential benefits of the USPIOs ferumoxtran-10 and ferumoxytol. We focus on central nervous system (CNS) MRI but also review imaging of other vascular beds. Safety studies, including USPIO administration (ferumoxytol) as iron supplement therapy in CKD patients on and not on dialysis, suggest that decreased kidney function does not alter the safety profile. We conclude that for both CNS MR imaging and MR angiography, USPIO agents like ferumoxytol are a viable option for patients at risk for NSF.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare four known pharmacokinetic models for their ability to describe dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of carotid atherosclerotic plaques, to determine reproducibility, and to validate the results with histologic findings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional medical ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Forty-five patients with 30%-99% carotid stenosis underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Plaque enhancement was measured at 16 time points at approximately 25-second image intervals by using a gadolinium-based contrast material. Pharmacokinetic parameters (volume transfer constant, K(trans); extracellular extravascular volume fraction, v(e); and blood plasma fraction, v(p)) were determined by fitting a two-compartment model to plaque and blood gadolinium concentration curves. The relative fit errors and parameter uncertainties were determined to find the most suitable model. Sixteen patients underwent imaging twice to determine reproducibility. Carotid endarterectomy specimens from 16 patients who were scheduled for surgery were collected for histologic validation. Parameter uncertainties were compared with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Reproducibility was assessed by using the coefficient of variation. Correlation with histologic findings was evaluated with the Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: The mean relative fit uncertainty ($\pm$standard error) for K(trans) was 10% $\pm$ 1 with the Patlak model, which was significantly lower than that with the Tofts (20% $\pm$ 1), extended Tofts (33% $\pm$ 3), and extended graphical (29% $\pm$ 3) models (P < .001). The relative uncertainty for v(p) was 20% $\pm$ 2 with the Patlak model and was significantly higher with the extended Tofts (46% $\pm$ 9) and extended graphical (35% $\pm$ 5) models (P < .001). The reproducibility (coefficient of variation) for the Patlak model was 16% for K(trans) and 26% for v(p). Significant positive correlations were found between K(trans) and the endothelial microvessel content determined on histologic slices (Pearson ρ = 0.72, P = .005).
CONCLUSION: The Patlak model is most suited for describing carotid plaque enhancement. Correlation with histologic findings validated K(trans) as an indicator of plaque microvasculature, and the reproducibility of K(trans) was good.},

@article{Larsen:2013aa,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: To investigate if perfusion measured with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can be used to differentiate radiation necrosis from tumor recurrence in patients with high-grade glioma.
METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional review board and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. 19 patients were recruited following surgery and radiation therapy for glioma. Patients had contrast enhancing lesions, which during the standard MRI examination could not be exclusively determined as recurrence or radiation necrosis. DCE-MRI was used to measure cerebral blood volume (CBV), blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Subjects also underwent FDG-PET and lesions were classified as either metabolically active or inactive. Follow-up clinical MRI and lesion histology in case of additional tissue resection was used to determine whether lesions were regressing or progressing.
RESULTS: Fourteen enhancing lesions could be classified as progressing (11) or regressing (three). An empirical threshold of 2.0 ml/100 g for CBV allowed detection of regressing lesions with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 100 %. FDG-PET and DCE-MRI agreed in classification of tumor status in 13 out of the 16 cases where an FDG-PET classification was obtained. In two of the remaining three patients, MRI follow-up and histology was available and both indicated that the DCE-MRI answer was correct.
CONCLUSION: CBV measurements using DCE-MRI may predict the status of contrast enhancing lesions and give results very similar to FDG-PET with regards to differentiation between tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was the intraindividual comparison of a 1.0 M and two 0.5 M gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) using equimolar dosing in dynamic and static magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the supra-aortic vessels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this institutional review board-approved study, a total of 20 healthy volunteers (mean $\pm$ SD age, 29 $\pm$ 6 years) underwent 3 consecutive supra-aortic MRA examinations on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance system. The order of GBCA (Gadobutrol, Gadobenate dimeglumine, and Gadoterate meglumine) was randomized with a minimum interval of 48 hours between the examinations. Before each examination and 45 minutes after each examination, circulatory parameters were recorded. Total GBCA dose per MRA examination was 0.1 mmol/kg with a 0.03 mmol/kg and 0.07 mmol/kg split for dynamic and static MRA, respectively, injected at a rate of 2 mL/s. Two blinded readers qualitatively assessed static MRA data sets independently using pairwise rankings (superior, inferior, and equal). In addition, quantitative analysis was performed with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) evaluation as well as vessel sharpness analysis of static MRA using an in-house-developed semiautomated tool. Dynamic MRA was evaluated for maximal SNR. Statistical analysis was performed using the Cohen κ, the Wilcoxon rank sum tests, and mixed effects models.
RESULTS: No significant differences of hemodynamic parameters were observed. In static MRA, Gadobutrol was rated superior to Gadoterate meglumine (P < 0.05) and equal to Gadobenate dimeglumine (P = 0.06) with good to excellent reader agreement (κ, 0.66-0.83). In static MRA, SNR was significantly higher using 1.0 M Gadobutrol as compared with either 0.5 M agent (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05) and CNR was significantly higher as compared with Gadoterate meglumine (P < 0.05), whereas CNR values of Gadobutrol data sets were not significantly different as compared with Gadobenate dimeglumine (P = 0.13). Differences in CNR between Gadobenate dimeglumine and Gadoterate meglumine were not significant (P = 0.78). Differences in vessel sharpness between the different GBCAs were also not significant (P > 0.05). Maximal SNR in dynamic MRA using Gadobutrol was significantly higher than both comparators at the level of the proximal and distal internal carotid artery (P < 0.05 and P < 0.05; P < 0.05 and P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: At equimolar doses, 1.0 M Gadobutrol demonstrates higher SNR/CNR than do Gadobenate dimeglumine and Gadoterate meglumine, with superior image quality as compared with Gadoterate meglumine for dynamic and static carotid MRA. Despite the shortened bolus with Gadobutrol, no blurring of vessel edges was observed.},

@article{Bernstein:1998aa,
	Abstract = {Whenever a linear gradient is activated, concomitant magnetic fields with non-linear spatial dependence result. This is a consequence of Maxwell's equations, i.e., within the imaging volume the magnetic field must have zero divergence, and has negligible curl. The concomitant, or Maxwell field has been described in the MRI literature for over 10 years. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally show the existence of two additional lowest-order terms in the concomitant field, which we call cross-terms. The concomitant gradient cross-terms only arise when the longitudinal gradient Gz is simultaneously active with a transverse gradient (Gx or Gy). The effect of all of the concomitant gradient terms on phase contrast imaging is examined in detail. Several methods for reducing or eliminating phase errors arising from the concomitant magnetic field are described. The feasibility of a joint pulse sequence-reconstruction method, which requires no increase in minimum TE, is demonstrated. Since the lowest-order terms of the concomitant field are proportional to G2/B0, the importance of concomitant gradient terms is expected to increase given the current interest in systems with stronger gradients and/or weaker main magnetic fields.},

	Abstract = {Time-resolved three-dimensional phase-contrast MRI is an important tool for physiological as well as clinical studies of blood flow in the heart and vessels. The application of the technique is, however, limited by the long scan times required. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using spiral readouts to reduce the scan time of four-dimensional flow MRI without sacrificing quality. Three spiral approaches are presented and evaluated in vivo and in vitro against a conventional Cartesian acquisition. In vivo, the performance of each method was assessed in the thoracic aorta in 10 volunteers using pathline-based analysis and cardiac output analysis. Signal-to-noise ratio and background phase errors were investigated in vitro. Using spiral readouts, the scan times of a four-dimensional flow acquisition of the thoracic aorta could be reduced 2-3-fold, with no statistically significant difference in pathline validity or cardiac output. The shortened scan time improves the applicability of four-dimensional flow MRI, which may allow the technique to become a part of a clinical workflow for cardiovascular functional imaging.},

A six-point measurement strategy is shown to be quite inefficient in terms of velocity variance per unit time. A simple four-point method exhibits equal dynamic range; its noise depends on flow direction but on average is equal to that of the six-point method. An alternate, balanced four-point method has noise that is direction independent and has, depending on implementation, possibly lower noise levels. Either four-point method is more efficient and is preferred over the six-point approach.},

	Abstract = {Non-Cartesian parallel imaging has played an important role in reducing data acquisition time in MRI. The use of non-Cartesian trajectories can enable more efficient coverage of k-space, which can be leveraged to reduce scan times. These trajectories can be undersampled to achieve even faster scan times, but the resulting images may contain aliasing artifacts. Just as Cartesian parallel imaging can be used to reconstruct images from undersampled Cartesian data, non-Cartesian parallel imaging methods can mitigate aliasing artifacts by using additional spatial encoding information in the form of the nonhomogeneous sensitivities of multi-coil phased arrays. This review will begin with an overview of non-Cartesian k-space trajectories and their sampling properties, followed by an in-depth discussion of several selected non-Cartesian parallel imaging algorithms. Three representative non-Cartesian parallel imaging methods will be described, including Conjugate Gradient SENSE (CG SENSE), non-Cartesian generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA), and Iterative Self-Consistent Parallel Imaging Reconstruction (SPIRiT). After a discussion of these three techniques, several potential promising clinical applications of non-Cartesian parallel imaging will be covered. J. Magn. Reson.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Inaccuracy of conventional four-dimensional (4D) flow MR imaging in the presence of random unsteady and turbulent blood flow distal to a narrowing has been an important challenge. Previous investigations have revealed that shorter echo times (TE) decrease the errors, leading to more accurate flow assessments.
METHODS: In this study, as part of a 4D flow acquisition, an Ultra-Short TE (UTE) method was adopted. UTE works based on a center-out radial k-space trajectory that inherently has a short TE. By employing free induction decay sampling starting from read-out gradient ramp-up, and by combining the refocusing lobe of the slice select gradient with the bipolar flow encoding gradient, TEs of ≈1 msec may be achieved.
RESULTS: Both steady and pulsatile flow regimes, and in each case a range of Reynolds numbers, were studied in an in-vitro model. Flow assessment at low and medium flow rates demonstrated a good agreement between 4D UTE and conventional 4D flow techniques. However, 4D UTE flow significantly outperformed conventional 4D flow, at high flow rates for both steady and pulsatile flow regimes. Feasibility of the method in one patient with Aortic Stenosis was also demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: For both steady and pulsatile high flow rates, the measured flow distal to the stenotic narrowing using conventional 4D flow revealed more than 20% error compared to the ground-truth flow. This error was reduced to less than 5% using the 4D UTE flow technique. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {For the last two years, we have been experimenting with applying compressed sensing parallel imaging for body imaging of pediatric patients. It is a joint-effort by teams from UC Berkeley, Stanford University and GE Healthcare. This paper aims to summarize our experience so far. We describe our acquisition approach: 3D spoiled-gradient-echo with poisson-disc random undersampling of the phase encodes. Our re-construction approach: ℓ1-SPIRiT, an iterative autocalibrating parallel imaging reconstruction that enforces both data consistency and joint-sparsity in the wavelet domain. Our implementation: an on-line parallelized implementation of ℓ1-SPIRiT on multi-core CPU and General Purpose Graphics Processors (GPGPU) that achieves sub-minute 3D reconstructions with 8-channels. Clinical results showing higher quality reconstruction and better diagnostic confidence than parallel imaging alone at accelerations on the order of number of coils.},

	Abstract = {In magnetic resonance imaging, highly parallel imaging using coil arrays with a large number of elements is an area of growing interest. With increasing channel numbers for parallel acquisition, the increased reconstruction time and extensive computer memory requirements have become significant concerns. In this work, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to develop a channel compression technique. This technique efficiently reduces the size of parallel imaging data acquired from a multichannel coil array, thereby significantly reducing the reconstruction time and computer memory requirement without undermining the benefits of multichannel coil arrays. Clinical data collected with a 32-channel cardiac coil are used in all of the experiments. The performance of the proposed method on parallel, partially acquired data, as well as fully acquired data, was evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed method dramatically reduces the processing time without considerable degradation in the quality of reconstructed images. It is also demonstrated that this PCA technique can be used to perform intensity correction in parallel imaging applications.},

	Abstract = {MRI using receiver arrays with many coil elements can provide high signal-to-noise ratio and increase parallel imaging acceleration. At the same time, the growing number of elements results in larger datasets and more computation in the reconstruction. This is of particular concern in 3D acquisitions and in iterative reconstructions. Coil compression algorithms are effective in mitigating this problem by compressing data from many channels into fewer virtual coils. In Cartesian sampling there often are fully sampled k-space dimensions. In this work, a new coil compression technique for Cartesian sampling is presented that exploits the spatially varying coil sensitivities in these nonsubsampled dimensions for better compression and computation reduction. Instead of directly compressing in k-space, coil compression is performed separately for each spatial location along the fully sampled directions, followed by an additional alignment process that guarantees the smoothness of the virtual coil sensitivities. This important step provides compatibility with autocalibrating parallel imaging techniques. Its performance is not susceptible to artifacts caused by a tight imaging field-of-view. High quality compression of in vivo 3D data from a 32 channel pediatric coil into six virtual coils is demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {Arrays with large numbers of independent coil elements are becoming increasingly available as they provide increased signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and improved parallel imaging performance. Processing of data from a large set of independent receive channels is, however, associated with an increased memory and computational load in reconstruction. This work addresses this problem by introducing coil array compression. The method allows one to reduce the number of datasets from independent channels by combining all or partial sets in the time domain prior to image reconstruction. It is demonstrated that array compression can be very effective depending on the size of the region of interest (ROI). Based on 2D in vivo data obtained with a 32-element phased-array coil in the heart, it is shown that the number of channels can be compressed to as few as four with only 0.3% SNR loss in an ROI encompassing the heart. With twofold parallel imaging, only a 2% loss in SNR occurred using the same compression factor.},

Three-dimensional cine-imaging of control and hypoxic mice was carried out at 4.7 T without magnetization preparation or ECG-triggering. The k-space lines were acquired with the TrueFISP sequence (pulse repetition time/echo time = 4/2 ms) in a repeated sequential manner. Retrospective reordering of raw data allowed the reconstruction of 10 three-dimensional images per cardiac cycle. The acquisition scheme used an alternating radiofrequency phase and sum-of-square reconstruction method. Black-blood three-dimensional images at around 200 mum resolution were produced without banding artifact throughout the cardiac cycle. High contrast to noise made it possible to estimate cavity volumes during diastole and systole. Right and left ventricular stroke volume was significantly higher in hypoxic mice vs controls (20.2 +/- 2 vs 15.1 +/- 2; P < 0.05, 24.9 +/- 2 vs 20.4 +/- 2; P < 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, four-dimensional black-blood TrueFISP imaging in living mice is a method of choice to investigate cardiac abnormalities in mouse models.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine the ability of TrueFISP imaging for evaluating tumor size in mouse brain at high field.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brains of healthy and glioma-implanted nude mice were imaged at 4.7T and 9.4T. 3D imaging was performed with TrueFISP and T2w-RARE. Radiofrequency pulses with alternating phase and the sum-of-squares reconstruction method were used in TrueFISP imaging. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was evaluated in healthy and in tumoral brain regions.
RESULTS: Banding artifact was correctly suppressed in TrueFISP images thanks to the method used. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CNR were comparable in TrueFISP and T2w-RARE images at 4.7T, but acquisition was around 4 times shorter with TrueFISP. Tumor was well detected at 4.7T with TrueFISP, but CNR between tumor and healthy tissue was low at 9.4T.
CONCLUSION: TrueFISP is efficient and fast to perform brain imaging at 4.7T. Multiple TrueFISP acquisitions with phase-cycled radiofrequency (RF) pulses and sum-of-squares reconstruction allow suppression of banding artifact. Tumoral regions were well detected and the method allows longitudinal studies of tumor growth.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To measure regional T1 and T2 values for normal C57Bl/6 mouse brain and changes in T1 after systemic administration of manganese chloride (MnCl2) at 9.4 T.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and baseline T1 and T2 measurements obtained prior to measurement of T1 after administration of MnCl2 at 9.4 T. MnCl2 was administered systemically either by the intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP), or subcutaneous (SC) routes. T1 and T2 maps for each MRI transverse slice were generated using commercial software, and T1 and T2 values of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), pituitary gland, and lateral ventricle were obtained.
RESULTS: When compared with baseline values at low-field, significant lengthening of the T1 values was shown at 9.4 T, while no significant change was seen for T2 values. Significant T1 shortening of the normal mouse brain was observed following IV, IP, and SC administration of MnCl2, with IV and IP showing similar acute effects. Significant decreases in T1 values were seen for the pituitary gland and the ventricles 15 minutes after either IV or IP injection. GM showed greater uptake of the contrast agent than WM at 15 and 45 minutes after either IV or IP injections. Although both structures are within the blood-brain barrier (BBB), GM and WM revealed a steady decrease in T1 values at 24 and 72 hours after MnCl2 injection regardless of the route of administration.
CONCLUSION: Systemic administration of MnCl2 by IV and IP routes induced similar time-course of T1 changes in different regions of the mouse brain. Acute effects of MnCl2 administration were mainly influenced by either the presence or absence of BBB. SC injection also provided significant T1 change at subacute stage after MnCl2 administration.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of first-pass contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using ferumoxytol in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: First-pass and equilibrium phase MRA were performed using ferumoxytol in one healthy volunteer and 11 patients with a fast three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) pulse sequence. The examined vessels included carotid arteries, thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, and peripheral arteries. A dose of either 71.6 micromol Fe/kg (n = 9), or 35.8 micromol Fe/kg (n = 3) was used. Based on a phantom study, the agent with initial concentration of 537.2 micromol Fe/mL was diluted by either four-fold (134.3 micromol Fe/mL) or eight-fold (67.1 micromol Fe/mL) for first-pass MRA.
RESULTS: All subjects completed their studies without adverse events. First-pass MRA showed selective arterial enhancement, with both arterial and venous enhancement on delayed acquisitions. Selective venous enhancement could be obtained by subtraction of arterial phase images from equilibrium phase images. The findings in ferumoxytol MRA were consistent with the results of original vascular tests.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience supports the feasibility of first-pass MRA with ferumoxytol. Satisfactory arterial enhancement during first-pass imaging is obtained with injection of diluted contrast agent. With ferumoxytol, arteries and veins can be selectively depicted in a single exam.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an undersampled anatomical, three-dimensional (3-D) time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) method for small animals based on time-of-flight (TOF) effect and radial sampling.
METHODS: Mouse carotid arteries and Circle of Willis images were acquired on a 7T scanner with an electrocardiogram (ECG)-triggered sequence. Preliminary experiments were used to generate an approximately uniform distribution of radial projections with a first golden angle and to produce anatomical TOF images. A second golden angle ratio between consecutive projections of cine acquisitions was added to make it possible to use a temporal filter during reconstruction of time-resolved angiography. A decreasing number of projections were tested, and their impact on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution was assessed.
RESULTS: In anatomical MRA, the undersampled radial approach efficiently allows fast acquisition of mouse angiogram in 3D (22 sec). It was also only slightly sensitive to motion and flow artifacts. The time-resolved sequence can be performed with only 2,500 projections per cine and a temporal resolution under 4 ms in a relatively short acquisition time (less than 5 min).
CONCLUSION: This technique simultaneously provided high 3D isotropic spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution with a good SNR level, allowing blood flow to be visualized in a restricted acquisition time. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Manganese (Mn) is a positive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that has been used to obtain physiological, biochemical, and molecular biological information. There is great interest to broaden its applications, but a major challenge is to increase detection sensitivity. Another challenge is distinguishing regions of Mn-related signal enhancement from background tissue with inherently similar contrast. To overcome these limitations, this study investigates the use of ultrashort echo time (UTE) and subtraction UTE (SubUTE) imaging for more sensitive and specific determination of Mn accumulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulations were performed to investigate the feasibility of UTE and SubUTE for Mn-enhanced MRI and to optimize imaging parameters. Phantoms containing aqueous Mn solutions were imaged on a MRI scanner to validate simulations predictions. Breast cancer cells that are very aggressive (MDA-MB-231 and a more aggressive variant LM2) and a less aggressive cell line (MCF7) were labeled with Mn and imaged on MRI. All imaging was performed on a 3 Tesla scanner and compared UTE and SubUTE against conventional T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) imaging.
RESULTS: Simulations and phantom imaging demonstrated that UTE and SubUTE provided sustained and linearly increasing positive contrast over a wide range of Mn concentrations, whereas conventional SPGR displayed signal plateau and eventual decrease. Higher flip angles are optimal for imaging higher Mn concentrations. Breast cancer cell imaging demonstrated that UTE and SubUTE provided high sensitivity, with SubUTE providing background suppression for improved specificity and eliminating the need for a pre-contrast baseline image. The SubUTE sequence allowed the best distinction of aggressive breast cancer cells.
CONCLUSIONS: UTE and SubUTE allow more sensitive and specific positive-contrast detection of Mn enhancement. This imaging capability can potentially open many new doors for Mn-enhanced MRI in vascular, cellular, and molecular imaging.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To obtain positive contrast based on T₁ weighting from magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) using ultrashort echo time (UTE) imaging and investigate quantitative relationship between positive contrast and the core size and concentration of IONPs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Solutions of IONPs with different core sizes and concentrations were prepared. T₁ and T₂ relaxation times of IONPs were measured using the inversion recovery turbo spin echo (TSE) and multi-echo spin echo sequences at 3 Tesla. T₁ -weighted UTE gradient echo and T₂-weighted TSE sequences were used to image IONP samples. U87MG glioblastoma cells bound with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide and IONP conjugates were scanned using UTE, T₁ and T₂-weighted sequences.
RESULTS: Positive contrast was obtained by UTE imaging from IONPs with different core sizes and concentrations. The relative-contrast-to-water ratio of UTE images was three to four times higher than those of T₂-weighted TSE images. The signal intensity increases as the function of the core size and concentration. Positive contrast was also evident in cell samples bound with RGD-IONPs.
CONCLUSION: UTE imaging allows for imaging of IONPs and IONP bound tumor cells with positive contrast and provides contrast enhancement and potential quantification of IONPs in molecular imaging applications.},

	Abstract = {At high magnetic fields diagnostic proton MRI of the lung is problematic, because of fast T2* relaxation. The application of superparamagnetic contrast agents and the exploitation of the corresponding T2* effect is inefficient with conventional MRI methods, which limits the early detection of lung diseases. However, a simple theoretical treatment shows that in the lung, by the use of ultra-short echo time sequences, T2* effects can be neglected while T(1) shortening effects can be used for signal detection. In our study, we have applied a theoretically and experimentally optimized 3D ultra-short echo time sequence to lung phantoms and to a mouse model of lung inflammation, which was induced by systemic bacterial infection. Following the systemic application of very small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, a significant signal increase in the lung of infected animals was detected already at 24 h postinfection, compared to control mice (17%, P < 0.001). Iron accumulation in the lung parenchyma as consequence of the host immune response was histologically confirmed. By conventional T2*- and T(2)-weighted imaging, neither structural changes nor formation of substantial edema were observed.},

	Abstract = {Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are used in various MRI applications as negative contrast agents. A major challenge is to distinguish regions of signal void due to IONPs from those due to low signal tissues or susceptibility artifacts. To overcome this limitation, several positive contrast strategies have been proposed. Relying on IONP T(1) shortening effects to generate positive contrast is a particularly appealing strategy because it should provide additional specificity when associated with the usual negative contrast from effective transverse relaxation time (T(2)*) effects. In this article, ultrashort echo time imaging is shown to be a powerful technique which can take full advantage of both contrast mechanisms. Methods of comparing T(1) and T(2)* contrast efficiency are described and general rules that allow optimizing IONP detection sensitivity are derived. Contrary to conventional wisdom, optimizing T(1) contrast is often a good strategy for imaging IONPs. Under certain conditions, subtraction of a later echo signal from the ultrashort echo time signal not only improves IONP specificity by providing long T(2)* background suppression but also increases detection sensitivity, as it enables a synergistic combination of usually antagonist T(1) and T(2)* contrasts. In vitro experiments support our theory, and a molecular imaging application is demonstrated using tumor-targeted IONPs in vivo.},

	Abstract = {The feasibility of imaging macrophages labeled with ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (USPIO) with fast low-angle positive contrast steady-state free precession (FLAPS) was investigated through theory and in vitro experiment. Human macrophage cells were labeled with USPIO and imaged at 1.5 T. The metric "visibility," which combines magnitude and spatial extent of positive contrast, was used to evaluate the images. Negative contrast steady-state free precession (SSFP) and gradient-echo (GRE) imaging were also evaluated. Positive contrast was observed for relatively high concentrations of labeled cells for flip angles less than alpha=25 degrees . Theoretical and experimental results indicate that positive visibility (VIS(POS)) was maximized at alpha=10 degrees and 15 degrees. Low flip angle SSFP also provided negative contrast comparable to standard SSFP and GRE imaging. Results suggest that USPIO-labeled macrophages are capable of producing the conditions necessary for positive contrast with FLAPS at clinical field strength (1.5 T) and resolution (0.8x0.8x3 mm(3)).},

	Abstract = {Parallel imaging reconstructions result in spatially varying noise amplification characterized by the g-factor, precluding conventional measurements of noise from the final image. A simple Monte Carlo based method is proposed for all linear image reconstruction algorithms, which allows measurement of signal-to-noise ratio and g-factor and is demonstrated for SENSE and GRAPPA reconstructions for accelerated acquisitions that have not previously been amenable to such assessment. Only a simple "prescan" measurement of noise amplitude and correlation in the phased-array receiver, and a single accelerated image acquisition are required, allowing robust assessment of signal-to-noise ratio and g-factor. The "pseudo multiple replica" method has been rigorously validated in phantoms and in vivo, showing excellent agreement with true multiple replica and analytical methods. This method is universally applicable to the parallel imaging reconstruction techniques used in clinical applications and will allow pixel-by-pixel image noise measurements for all parallel imaging strategies, allowing quantitative comparison between arbitrary k-space trajectories, image reconstruction, or noise conditioning techniques.},

	Abstract = {T(2) decay during long echo trains of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pulse sequences is known to cause a blurring effect, due to the peak broadening of the point spread function (PSF). In contrast, the simultaneous amplitude-loss effect, led by the peak reduction of the PSF, has gained much less attention. In this report, we analyzed the PSFs of both the truncation and T(2) decay for Cartesian (linear profile ordering and low-high ordering) and spiral trajectories, respectively. Then, we derived simple formulas to characterize both the blurring and amplitude-loss effects, which are functions of the ratios of the echo train duration (T(k)) over T(2) (T(k)/T(2)). Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per unit time was thus analyzed considering both the amplitude-loss effect induced by the T(2) decay and the SNR gain from the long acquisition duration based on MR sampling theory. Optimum T(k)/T(2) ratios to achieve maximum SNR per unit time were 1.2 for the Cartesian trajectory and 0.8 for the spiral trajectory.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of high-resolution late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging using a three-dimensional (3D) stack of spirals k-space trajectory for the detection of left atrial (LA) ablation lesions. LGE imaging inherently suffers from low SNR, so that improvements in spatial resolution and imaging time are challenging. The spiral trajectory offers greater acquisition efficiency, and this is used for increased spatial resolution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine healthy subjects and 10 pre/post pulmonary vein isolation patients underwent an MRI examination. A Cartesian 3D inversion-recovery gradient-echo sequence was performed followed by a 3D inversion-recovery gradient-echo with a spiral trajectory. Image quality, fat suppression and sharpness were graded by expert cardiologists.
RESULTS: No statistical significance was determined for SNR or image quality between the Cartesian and spiral images; however, fat suppression was significantly improved with the spiral approach (P = 0.002). The enhancement in the Cartesian scan was found to have significantly higher CNR (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: The feasibility of spiral LGE in the left atrium has been demonstrated. Similar image quality and sharpness were observed with both acquisitions. This spiral sequence has sub-millimeter spatial resolution improved fat suppression and maintains a comparable level of SNR compared with the Cartesian scan.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the ability of inversion recovery ON-resonant water suppression (IRON) in conjunction with P904 (superparamagnetic nanoparticles which consisting of a maghemite core coated with a low-molecular-weight amino-alcohol derivative of glucose) to perform steady-state equilibrium phase MR angiography (MRA) over a wide dose range.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committee. Rabbits (n = 12) were imaged at baseline and serially after the administration of 10 incremental dosages of 0.57-5.7 mgFe/Kg P904. Conventional T1-weighted and IRON MRA were obtained on a clinical 1.5 Tesla (T) scanner to image the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and peripheral vessels. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and vessel sharpness were quantified.
RESULTS: Using IRON MRA, CNR and vessel sharpness progressively increased with incremental dosages of the contrast agent P904, exhibiting constantly higher contrast values than T1 -weighted MRA over a very wide range of contrast agent doses (CNR of 18.8 $\pm$ 5.6 for IRON versus 11.1 $\pm$ 2.8 for T1 -weighted MRA at 1.71 mgFe/kg, P = 0.02 and 19.8 $\pm$ 5.9 for IRON versus -0.8 $\pm$ 1.4 for T1-weighted MRA at 3.99 mgFe/kg, P = 0.0002). Similar results were obtained for vessel sharpness in peripheral vessels, (Vessel sharpness of 46.76 $\pm$ 6.48% for IRON versus 33.20 $\pm$ 3.53% for T1-weighted MRA at 1.71 mgFe/Kg, P = 0.002, and of 48.66 $\pm$ 5.50% for IRON versus 19.00 $\pm$ 7.41% for T1-weighted MRA at 3.99 mgFe/Kg, P = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that quantitative CNR and vessel sharpness after the injection of P904 are consistently higher for IRON MRA when compared with conventional T1-weighted MRA. These findings apply for a wide range of contrast agent dosages.},

	Abstract = {Accurate measurement of peak velocity is critical to the assessment of patients with stenotic valvular disease. Conventional phase contrast (PC) methods for imaging high-velocity jets in aortic stenosis are susceptible to intravoxel dephasing signal loss, which can result in unreliable measurements. The most effective method for reducing intravoxel dephasing is to shorten the echo time (TE); however, the amount that TE can be shortened in conventional sequences is limited. A new sequence incorporating velocity-dependent slice excitation and ultrashort TE (UTE) centric radial readout trajectories is proposed that reduces TE from 2.85 to 0.65 ms. In a high-velocity stenotic jet phantom, a conventional sequence had >5% flow error at a flow rate of only 400 mL/s (velocity >358 cm/s), whereas the PC-UTE showed excellent agreement (<5% error) at much higher flow rates (1080 mL/s, 965 cm/s). In vivo feasibility studies demonstrated that by measuring velocity over a shorter time the PC-UTE approach is more robust to intravoxel dephasing signal loss. It also has less inherent higher-order motion encoding. This sequence therefore demonstrates potential as a more robust method for measuring peak velocity and flow in high-velocity turbulent stenotic jets.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To overcome flow and electrocardiogram-trigger artifacts in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), we have implemented a cardiac and respiratory self-gated cine ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence. We have assessed its performance in healthy mice by comparing the results with those obtained with a self-gated cine fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequence and with echocardiography.
METHODS: 2D self-gated cine UTE (TE/TR = 314 mus/6.2 ms, resolution: 129 x 129 mum, scan time per slice: 5 min 5 sec) and self-gated cine FLASH (TE/TR = 3 ms/6.2 ms, resolution: 129 x 129 mum, scan time per slice: 4 min 49 sec) images were acquired at 9.4 T. Volume of the left and right ventricular (LV, RV) myocardium as well as the end-diastolic and -systolic volume was segmented manually in MR images and myocardial mass, stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and cardiac output (CO) were determined. Statistical differences were analyzed by using Student t test and Bland-Altman analyses.
RESULTS: Self-gated cine UTE provided high quality images with high contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) also for the RV myocardium (CNRblood-myocardium = 25.5 +/- 7.8). Compared to cine FLASH, susceptibility, motion, and flow artifacts were considerably reduced due to the short TE of 314 mus. The aortic valve was clearly discernible over the entire cardiac cycle. Myocardial mass, SV, EF and CO determined by self-gated UTE were identical to the values measured with self-gated FLASH and showed good agreement to the results obtained by echocardiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Self-gated UTE allows for robust measurement of cardiac parameters of diagnostic interest. Image quality is superior to self-gated FLASH, rendering the method a powerful alternative for the assessment of cardiac function at high magnetic fields.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this work is to investigate the hypothesis that uniform sampling measurements that are endowed with antipodal symmetry play an important role in image quality when the raw data and image data are related through the Fourier relationship. Currently, it is extremely challenging to generate large and uniform antipodally symmetric point sets suitable for three-dimensional radial MRI. A novel approach is proposed to solve this long-standing problem in a unique and optimal way. METHODS: The proposed method is based on constrained centroidal Voronoi tessellations of the upper hemisphere with a novel pseudometric. RESULTS: The time complexity of the proposed tessellations was shown to be effectively linear, i.e., on the order of the number of sampling measurements. For small sample size, the proposed method was comparable with the state-of-the-art method (a direct iterative minimization of the electrostatic potential energy of a collection of electrons antipodal-symmetrically distributed on the unit sphere) in terms of the sampling uniformity. For large sample size, in which the state-of-the-art method is infeasible, the reconstructed images from the proposed method has less streak and ringing artifacts, when compared with those of the commonly used methods. CONCLUSION: This work proposed a unique and optimal approach to solving a long-standing problem in generating uniform sampling points for three-dimensional radial MRI.

	Abstract = {Conventional methods to quantify infarct size after myocardial infarction in mice are not ideal, requiring either tissue destruction for histology or relying on nondirect measurements such as wall motion. We therefore implemented a fast, high-resolution method to directly measure infarct size in vivo using three-dimensional (3D) late gadolinium enhancement MRI (3D-LGE). Myocardial T1 relaxation was quantified at 9.4 Tesla in five mice, and reproducibility was tested by repeat imaging after 5 days. In a separate set of healthy and infarcted mice (n = 8 of each), continuous T1 measurements were made following intravenous or intraperitoneal injection of a contrast agent (0.5 micromol/g gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid). The time course of T1 contrast development between viable and nonviable myocardium was thereby determined, with optimal postinjection imaging windows and inversion times identified. Infarct sizes were quantified using 3D-LGE and compared with triphenyltetrazolium chloride histology on day 1 after infarction (n = 8). Baseline myocardial T1 was highly reproducible: the mean value was 952 +/- 41 ms. T1 contrast peaked earlier after intravenous injection than with intraperitoneal injection; however, contrast between viable and nonviable myocardium was comparable for both routes (P = 0.31), with adequate contrast remaining for at least 60 min postinjection. Excellent correlation was obtained between infarct sizes derived from 3D-LGE and histology (r = 0.91, P = 0.002), and Bland-Altman analysis indicated good agreement free from systematic bias. We have validated an improved 3D MRI method to noninvasively quantify infarct size in mice with unsurpassed spatial resolution and tissue contrast. This method is particularly suited to studies requiring early quantification of initial infarct size, for example, to measure damage before intervention with stem cells.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic implications of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) have been evaluated in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. The present study analyzed LGE distribution in patients with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ES-HCM) and with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and tried to identify high risk patients in DCM.
METHODS: Eleven patients with ES-HCM and 72 with DCM underwent cine- and LGE-cardiac magnetic resonance and ultrasound cardiography. The patient outcome was analyzed retrospectively for 5years of follow-up.
RESULTS: LGE distributed mainly in the inter-ventricular septum, but spread more diffusely into other left ventricular segments in patients with ES-HCM and in a certain part of patients with DCM. Thus, patients with DCM can be divided into three groups according to LGE distribution; no LGE (n=24), localized LGE (localized at septum, n=36), and extensive LGE (spread into other segments, n=12). Reverse remodeling occurred after treatment in patients with no LGE and with localized LGE, but did not in patients with extensive LGE and with ES-HCM. The event-free survival rate for composite outcome (cardiac death, hospitalization for decompensated heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias) was lowest in patients with extensive LGE (92%, 74% and 42% in no LGE, localized LGE, and extensive LGE, p=0.02 vs. no LGE), and was comparable to that in patients with ES-HCM (42%).
CONCLUSIONS: In DCM, patients with extensive LGE showed no functional recovery and the lowest event-free survival rate that were comparable to patients with ES-HCM. The analysis of LGE distribution may be valuable to predict reverse remodeling and to identify high-risk patients.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate and validate a late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging protocol, optimized for tissue viability assessment in interventional mouse models of myocardial infarction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method uses an efficient sampling scheme using multiple slices in a single heartbeat interleaving slice packages between alternate TRs. Sampling multiple slices instead of multiple echoes or multiple k-lines achieves higher SNR efficiency, and images covering the whole heart can be obtained in 3 min. Saturation effects are exploited for an optimum compromise between contrast and speed.
RESULTS: The images obtained show high hyperenhancement with good contrast-to-noise. It is shown that inversion time optimization can be reliably omitted with this scheme, and that measured infarct sizes correlate well with histological measures.
CONCLUSION: Our protocol offers a new efficient tool for the measurement of infarct size in mouse models of heart disease.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility and sensitivity of the modified CINE inversion recovery (mCINE-IR) acquisition on rats for measuring the myocardial T1 at 7 Tesla.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The recently published mCINE-IR acquisition on humans was applied on rats for the first time, enabling the possibility of translational studies with an identical sequence. Simulations were used to study signal evolution and heart rate dependency. Gadolinium phantoms, a heart specimen and a healthy rat were used to study reproducibility. Two cryo-infarcted rats were scanned to measure late gadolinium enhancement (LGE).
RESULTS: In the phantom reproducibility studies the T1 measurements had a maximum coefficient of variation (COV) of 1.3%. For the in vivo reproducibility the COV was below 5% in the anterior cardiac segments. In simulations with phantoms and specimens, a heart rate dependency of approximately 0.5 ms/bpm was present. The T1 maps of the cryo-infarcted rats showed a clear lowering of T1 in de LGE region.
CONCLUSION: The results show that mCINE-IR is highly reproducible and that the sensitivity allows detecting T1 changes in the rat myocardium.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2013. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate myocardial infarction (MI), late gadolinium (Gd) enhancement (LGE), cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is used as the current gold standard for the in vivo diagnosis in patients and preclinical studies. While inversion recovery (IR) fast gradient echo LGE imaging is the preferred technique at clinical field strengths it remains to be investigated which is the best sequence at higher field strength. We therefore compared the IR technique against cine fast low shot angle (cine-FLASH) for the quantification of MI size in mice at 7T in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five mice were used to optimize cine-FLASH and IR parameters. Nine mice were subsequently imaged with optimized parameters using both techniques 2-3 days after MI and ≈30 minutes post Gd injection.
RESULTS: The difference in infarct size values was within 3.3% between the two CMRI techniques and within 7.5% of histological values by Bland-Altman analysis. Contrast-to-noise-ratio between infarcted and normal tissue as well as blood was higher for cine-FLASH with the additional benefit of a 2-time-fold shorter scan time than with the IR method. Furthermore, left ventricular function/volumes could be calculated from cine-FLASH images before as well as after Gd injection.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, cine-FLASH LGE MRI represents an attractive alternative to IR LGE MRI for infarct size assessment in mice at high field strengths because it provides similar accuracy while being more robust, faster, and less user dependent.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate phase-sensitive inversion-recovery (PSIR) imaging at 1.5 T in a mouse model of permanent coronary artery ligation as a potentially rapid and robust alternative for the accurate assessment of myocardial infarction (MI) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PSIR late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging was compared to conventional 2D segmented inversion-recovery imaging for the assessment of murine MI.
RESULTS: PSIR images provided comparable contrast and kinetics of intravenously injected gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). At the mid-ventricular level there was good agreement between conventional IR and PSIR for infarct size assessment. After intravenous injection a limited time window of ∼6 minutes is available for delayed enhancement imaging in mice. Whole-heart infarct imaging with 1 mm thick slices was only possible in this restricted time frame when the PSIR method is applied, avoiding the need for repetitively adapting the correct inversion time. Infarct size determined by PSIR MRI demonstrated good agreement with postmortem histology. Infarct size determined by PSIR LGE MRI inversely correlates with left-ventricular function on day 7 after MI.
CONCLUSION: The PSIR technique provides stable and consistent contrast between hyperenhanced and remote myocardium independent of the selected inversion time (TI) and proved to be a robust, fast, and accurate tool for the assessment of MI in mice.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and demonstrate a breathheld 3D radial ultrashort echo time (UTE) acquisition to visualize co-registered lung perfusion and vascular structure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine healthy dogs were scanned twice at 3 Tesla (T). Contrast-enhanced pulmonary perfusion scans were acquired with a temporally interleaved three-dimensional (3D) radial UTE (TE = 0.08 ms) sequence in a breathhold (1 s time frames over a 33 s breathhold). The 3D breathheld volume was reconstructed into time-resolved perfusion datasets, and a composite vascular structure dataset. For structural comparison, a 5 min respiratory-gated 3D radial UTE scan was acquired. Data were analyzed by quantitative metrics and radiologist scoring.
RESULTS: Appropriate time-course of contrast was seen in all subjects. Right ventricle to aorta transit times were 7.4 $\pm$ 2.0 s. Relative lung enhancement was a factor of 8.4 $\pm$ 1.5. Radiologist scoring showed similarly excellent visualization of the pulmonary arteries to the subsegmental level in breathheld (94% of cases) and respiratory-gated (100% of cases) acquisitions (P = 0.33) despite the aggressive under sampling in the breathheld scan. Similarly, differentiation of lung tissue and airways was achieved by both acquisition methods.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate a fast T1 mapping technique using incomplete inversion recovery 3D balanced steady-state free precession acquisition along with a two-parameter model fit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Bloch simulations, we explored the two-parameter model fit for data acquired using such an acquisition scheme. The parameter space over which the fit holds good was determined through simulations. A linear correction was derived for the R1* (1/T1*) values so determined. Two phantoms and six volunteers were scanned using the described technique. Comparison scans using full recovery as well as gold standard inversion recovery spin echo were also performed.
RESULTS: The two-parameter fit works exceedingly well over a large parameter space. T1 values in the phantoms showed an error of 4.9% and 39% before correction and 0.9% and 1.6% after correction. For the six volunteers, error in T1 value was 5.3% for white matter (WM) and 2.4% for gray matter (GM) after correction, while it was 11.2% and 18.2% before correction.
CONCLUSION: The work presented here allows for T1 map determination with higher resolution and shorter acquisition time than previously possible. The technique is especially well suited for GM/WM T1 mapping.},

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) Look-Locker (LL) acquisition is a widely used fast and efficient T1 mapping method. However, the multi-shot approach of 3D LL acquisition can introduce reconstruction artifacts that result in intensity distortions. Traditional 3D LL acquisition generally utilizes a centric encoding scheme that is limited to a single phase-encoding direction in k space. To optimize k-space segmentation, an elliptical scheme with two phase-encoding directions is implemented for the LL acquisition. This elliptical segmentation can reduce the intensity errors in the reconstructed images and improve the final T1 estimation. One of the major sources of error in LL-based T1 estimation is a lack of accurate knowledge of the actual flip angle. A multi-parameter curve-fitting procedure can account for some of the variability in the flip angle. However, curve fitting can also introduce errors in the estimated flip angle that can result in incorrect T1 values. A filtering procedure based on goodness of fit (GOF) is proposed to reduce the effect of false flip angle estimates. Filtering based on GOF weighting can remove probable incorrect angles that result in bad curve fitting. Simulation, phantom and in vivo studies have demonstrated that these techniques can improve the accuracy of 3D LL T1 estimation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concentration of gadopentetate dimeglumine in myocardium and blood can be assessed from T1 measurements and can be used to calculate the extracellular volume (ECV) of the myocardium. We hypothesized that diffuse myocardial fibrosis in a small-animal model could be quantitatively assessed by measuring myocardial ECV using small-animal Look-Locker inversion recovery T1 mapping.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Sprague-Dawley rats (n=10) were subjected to continuous angiotensin-2 (AT2) infusion for 2 weeks via a subcutaneously implanted minipump system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed both before and after AT2 infusion. The MRI protocol included multislice cine imaging and before-and-after contrast small-animal Look-Locker inversion recovery T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement imaging. Myocardial ECV was calculated from hematocrit and T1 values of blood and myocardium. During the course of AT2 infusion, the mean$\pm$SD systolic blood pressure increased from 122$\pm$10.9 to 152$\pm$27.5 mm Hg (P=0.003). Normalized heart weight was significantly higher in AT2-treated animals than in control littermates (P=0.033). Cine MRI documented concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Postcontrast myocardial T1 times were shortened after treatment (median [interquartile range], 712 [63] versus 820 [131] ms; P=0.002). Myocardial ECV increased from 17.2% (4.3%) before to 23.0% (6.2%) after AT2 treatment (P=0.031), which was accompanied by perivascular fibrosis and microscarring on myocardial histological analysis. There was a moderate level of correlation between ECV and collagen volume fraction, as assessed by histological analysis (r=0.69, P=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: In a small-animal model of left ventricular hypertrophy, contrast-enhanced T1 mapping can be used to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis by quantification of myocardial ECV.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI using gadolinium or manganese provides unique characterization of myocardium and its pathology. In this study, an electrocardiography (ECG) triggered saturation recovery Look-Locker method was developed and validated for fast cardiac T(1) mapping in small animal models. By sampling the initial portion of the longitudinal magnetization recovery curve, high temporal resolution (∼ 3 min) can be achieved at a high spatial resolution (195 × 390 μm2) in mouse heart without the aid of parallel imaging or echo-planar imaging. Validation studies were performed both in vitro on a phantom and in vivo on C57BL/6 mice (n = 6). Our results showed a strong agreement between T(1) measured by saturation recovery Look-Locker and by the standard saturation recovery method in vitro or inversion recovery Look-Locker in vivo. The utility of saturation recovery Look-Locker in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI studies was demonstrated in manganese-enhanced MRI experiments in mice. Our results suggest that saturation recovery Look-Locker can provide rapid and accurate cardiac T(1) mapping for studies using small animal models.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) can be readily assessed using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Inversion recovery (IR) sequences provide the highest contrast between enhanced infarct areas and healthy myocardium. Applying such methods to small animals is challenging due to rapid respiratory and cardiac rates relative to T1 relaxation.
METHODS: Here we present a fast and robust protocol for assessing LGE in small animals using a multi-slice IR gradient echo sequence for efficient assessment of LGE. An additional Look-Locker sequence was used to assess the optimum inversion point on an individual basis and to determine most appropriate gating points for both rat and mouse. The technique was applied to two preclinical scenarios: i) an acute (2 hour) reperfused model of MI in rats and ii) mice 2 days following non-reperfused MI.
RESULTS: LGE images from all animals revealed clear areas of enhancement allowing for easy volume segmentation. Typical inversion times required to null healthy myocardium in rats were between 300-450 ms equivalent to 2-3 R-waves and ~330 ms in mice, typically 3 R-waves following inversion. Data from rats was also validated against triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and revealed close agreement for infarct size.
CONCLUSION: The LGE protocol presented provides a reliable method for acquiring images of high contrast and quality without excessive scan times, enabling higher throughput in experimental studies requiring reliable assessment of MI.},

	Abstract = {Small animal magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool to study cardiac function and changes in myocardial tissue. The high heart rates of small animals (200 to 600 beats/min) have previously limited the role of CMR imaging. Small animal Look-Locker inversion recovery (SALLI) is a T1 mapping sequence for small animals to overcome this problem. T1 maps provide quantitative information about tissue alterations and contrast agent kinetics. It is also possible to detect diffuse myocardial processes such as interstitial fibrosis or edema. Furthermore, from a single set of image data, it is possible to examine heart function and myocardial scarring by generating cine and inversion recovery-prepared late gadolinium enhancement-type MR images. The presented video shows step-by-step the procedures to perform small animal CMR imaging. Here it is presented with a healthy Sprague-Dawley rat, however naturally it can be extended to different cardiac small animal models.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a single magnetic resonance (MR) imaging approach for comprehensive assessment of cardiac function and tissue properties in small animals with high heart rates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All animal studies were approved by the local animal care committee. Small animal Look-Locker inversion recovery (SALLI) was implemented on a clinical 3.0-T MR unit equipped with a 70-mm solenoid coil. SALLI combines a segmented, electrocardiographically gated, inversion recovery-prepared Look-Locker-type pulse sequence with a multimodal reconstruction framework. Temporal undersampling and radial nonbalanced steady-state free precession enabled acceleration of data acquisition and reduction of motion artifacts, respectively. Nine agarose gel phantoms were used to investigate different sequence settings. For in vivo studies, 10 Sprague-Dawley rats were evaluated to establish normal T1 values before and after injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Seven rats with surgically induced acute myocardial infarction were examined to test the feasibility of detecting myocardial injury. In vitro T1 behavior was studied with linear regression analysis, and in vivo T1 differences between infarcted and remote areas were tested by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: Phantom studies demonstrated systematic behavior of the T1 measurements, and T1 error could be reduced to 1.3% $\pm$ 7.4 by using a simple linear correction algorithm. The pre- and postcontrast T1 of myocardium and blood showed narrow normal ranges. In the area of infarction, SALLI demonstrated hypokinesia (on cine images), myocardial edema (on precontrast T1 maps), and myocardial necrosis (on postcontrast T1 maps and late gadolinium enhancement images). Conclusion: An MR imaging method enabling simultaneous generation of cardiac T1 maps and cine and inversion recovery-prepared images at high heart rates is presented. SALLI allows for simultaneous and time-efficient assessment of cardiac T1 behavior, function, and late gadolinium enhancement at high heart rates.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we present a first-pass perfusion imaging protocol to determine quantitative regional perfusion values (in mL min(-1) g(-1)) of the mouse myocardium. Perfusion was quantified using a Fermi-constrained deconvolution of the myocardial tissue response with the arterial input function. A dual-bolus approach was implemented. Experimental evidence is presented for the linearity of signal intensity in the left-ventricular lumen during the prebolus (r=0.99, P<0.001) and in the myocardium during the full-bolus injection (r=0.99, P<0.01) as function of Gd(DTPA)2- injection concentration used. The prebolus was used to reconstruct a nonsaturated arterial input function. Regional perfusion values proved repeatable in a cohort of nine healthy C57BL/6 mice. The perfusion values over two measurements with a 1-week interval were 7.3$\pm$0.9 and 7.2$\pm$0.6 mL min(-1) g(-1), respectively. No effects of time (P>0.05) and myocardial region (P>0.05) were observed. The between-session coefficient of variation was only 6%, whereas the inter-animal coefficient of variation was 11 and 8% for the separate experiments. We expect that the first-pass perfusion method here presented will be useful in preclinical studies of myocardial perfusion deficits and valuable to assess the impact of pro-angiogenic therapy after myocardial infarction.},

A segmented ECG-triggered acquisition combined with parallel imaging acceleration was used to capture the first pass of a Gd-DTPA bolus through the mouse heart with a temporal resolution of 300-400 msec. The method was applied in healthy mice (N = 5) and in mice with permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery (N = 6). Baseline semiquantitative perfusion values of healthy myocardium showed excellent reproducibility. Infarct regions revealed a significant decrease in the semiquantitative myocardial perfusion values (0.05 $\pm$ 0.02) compared to remote myocardium (0.20 $\pm$ 0.04). Myocardial areas of decreased perfusion correlated well to infarct areas identified on the delayed-enhancement scans. This protocol is a valuable addition to the mouse cardiac MRI toolbox for preclinical studies of ischemic heart disease.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic first pass contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion is the standard CMR method for the estimation of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and MBF reserve in man, but it is challenging in rodents because of the high temporal and spatial resolution requirements. Hyperemic first pass myocardial perfusion CMR during vasodilator stress in mice has not been reported.
METHODS: Five C57BL/6 J mice were scanned on a clinical 3.0 Tesla Achieva system (Philips Healthcare, Netherlands). Vasodilator stress was induced via a tail vein catheter with an injection of dipyridamole. Dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging (Gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg) was based on a saturation recovery spoiled gradient echo method with 10-fold k-space and time domain undersampling (k-t PCA). One week later the mice underwent repeat anaesthesia and LV injections of fluorescent microspheres at rest and at stress. Microspheres were analysed using confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
RESULTS: Mean MBF at rest measured by Fermi-function constrained deconvolution was 4.1 +/- 0.5 ml/g/min and increased to 9.6 +/- 2.5 ml/g/min during dipyridamole stress (P = 0.005). The myocardial perfusion reserve was 2.4 +/-0.54. The mean count ratio of stress to rest microspheres was 2.4 +/-0.51 using confocal microscopy and 2.6 +/- 0.46 using fluorescence. There was good agreement between cardiovascular magnetic resonance CMR and microspheres with no significant difference (P = 0.84).
CONCLUSION: First-pass myocardial stress perfusion CMR in a mouse model is feasible at 3Tesla. Rest and stress MBF values were consistent with existing literature and perfusion reserve correlated closely to microsphere analysis. Data were acquired on a 3 Tesla scanner using an approach similar to clinical acquisition protocols, potentially facilitating translation of imaging findings between rodent and human studies.},

	Abstract = {First-pass contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion MRI in rodents has so far not been possible due to the temporal and spatial resolution requirements. We developed a new first-pass perfusion MR method for rodent imaging on a clinical 3.0-T scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) that employed 10-fold k-space and time domain undersampling with constrained image reconstruction, using temporal basis sets (k-t principle component analysis) to achieve a spatial resolution of 0.2 × 0.2 × 1.5mm(3) and an acquisition window of 43 msec. The method was successfully tested in five healthy and four infarcted mice (C57BL/6J) at heart rates of 495.1 $\pm$ 45.8 beats/min. Signal-intensity-time profiles showed a percentage myocardial signal increase of 141.3 $\pm$ 38.9% in normal mice, compared with 44.7 $\pm$ 32.4% in infarcted segments. Mean myocardial blood flow by Fermi function for constrained deconvolution in control mice was 7.3 $\pm$ 1.5 mL/g/min, comparable to published literature, with no significant differences between three myocardial segments. In infarcted segments, myocardial blood flow was significantly reduced to 1.2 $\pm$ 0.8 mL/g/min (P < 0.01). This is the first report of first-pass myocardial perfusion MR in a mouse model on a clinical 3-T MR scanner and using a k-t undersampling method. Data were acquired on a 3-T scanner, using an approach similar to clinical acquisition protocols, thus facilitating translation of imaging findings between rodent and human studies.},

	Abstract = {Mouse models are increasingly used to study the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction in vivo. In this area, MRI has become the gold standard imaging modality, because it combines high spatial and temporal resolution functional imaging with a large variety of methods to generate soft tissue contrast. In addition, (target-specific) MRI contrast agents can be employed to visualize different processes in the cascade of events following myocardial infarction. Here, the MRI sequence has a decisive role in the detection sensitivity of a contrast agent. However, a straightforward translation of clinically available protocols for human cardiac imaging to mice is not feasible, because of the small size of the mouse heart and its extremely high heart rate. This has stimulated intense research in the development of cardiac MRI protocols specifically tuned to the mouse with regard to timing parameters, acquisition strategies, and ECG- and respiratory-triggering methods to find an optimal trade-off between sensitivity, scan time, and image quality. In this review, a detailed analysis is given of the pros and cons of different mouse cardiac MR imaging methodologies and their application in contrast-enhanced MRI of myocardial infarction.},

	Abstract = {Arterial spin labeling has been developed and used for the quantitative and completely noninvasive assessment of myocardial perfusion in vivo. Here we propose a novel arterial spin labeling method called cine-ASL, which is based on an electrocardiogram-gated steady-pulsed labeling approach combined with simultaneous readout over the cardiac cycle using cine-fast low-angle shot. This method led to shorter acquisition times than the previously used Look-Locker flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery gradient-echo technique while preserving spatial resolution and robustness with respect to cardiac motion. High resolution perfusion mapping (in-plane resolution = 195 μm × 391 μm) was carried out with both techniques at 4.7 T in a group of 14 healthy mice. Mean perfusion values were 5.0 $\pm$ 0.8 mL g(-1) min(-1) with cine-ASL and 5.9 $\pm$ 1.4 mL g(-1) min(-1) with Look-Locker flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery. In one animal, physiological stress was induced with higher anesthetic concentration to evaluate the response of both methods under vasodilation. Global myocardial perfusion increased from 5.6 to 16.0 mL g(-1) min(-1) with cine-ASL and from 6.3 to 18.7 mL g(-1) min(-1) with Look-Locker flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery. Although this original scheme requires a separate T1 measurement to be fully quantitative, it improves arterial spin labeling sensitivity while maintaining compatibility with motion constraints in cardiac MRI in small rodents.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging has broad clinical applications by virtue of its high time efficiency and desirable contrast. Unfortunately, banding artifact is often seen as a result of signal modulation due to B0 inhomogeneity. This study aims to develop an effective method for banding artifact suppression.
METHODS: bSSFP is analyzed with an elliptical signal model. A simple analytical "Geometric-Solution" (GS) is presented to demodulate the signal from B0 inhomogeneity dependence with phase-cycled bSSFP data from both a computer simulation and experiments using phantom and human subjects.
RESULTS: The proposed algorithm is able to remove banding artifacts completely. It also compares favorably with the complex sum (CS), which is considered one of the more efficient methods for banding artifact correction.
CONCLUSION: Using an elliptical signal model, an analytical solution to the bSSFP banding problem has been found and demonstrated with simulation as well as phantom and in vivo experiments. Magn Reson Med, 2014. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Refocused steady-state free precession (SSFP) is limited by its high sensitivity to local field variation, particularly at high field strengths or the long repetition times (TRs) necessary for high resolution. Several methods have been proposed to reduce SSFP banding artifact by combining multiple phase-cycled SSFP acquisitions, each differing in how individual signal magnitudes and phases are combined. These include maximum-intensity SSFP (MI-SSFP) and complex-sum SSFP (CS-SSFP). The reduction in SSFP banding is accompanied by a loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. In this work a general framework for analyzing banding artifact reduction, contrast, and SNR of any multiple-acquisition SSFP combination method is presented. A new sum-of-squares method is proposed, and a comparison is performed between each of the combination schemes. The sum-of-squares SSFP technique (SOS-SSFP) delivers both robust banding artifact reduction and higher SNR efficiency than other multiple-acquisition techniques, while preserving SSFP contrast.},

	Abstract = {Balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) imaging is limited by off-resonance banding artifacts, which occur with periodicity 1/TR in the frequency spectrum. A novel balanced SSFP technique for widening the band spacing in the frequency response is described. This method, called wideband SSFP, utilizes two alternating repetition times with alternating RF phase, and maintains high SNR and T(2)/T(1) contrast. For a fixed band spacing, this method can enable improvements in spatial resolution compared to conventional SSFP. Alternatively, for a fixed readout duration this method can widen the band spacing, and potentially avoid the banding artifacts in conventional SSFP. The method is analyzed using simulations and phantom experiments, and is applied to the reduction of banding artifacts in cine cardiac imaging and high-resolution knee imaging at 3T.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To improve myocardial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by reconstructing undersampled radial data with a spatiotemporal constrained reconstruction method (STCR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The STCR method jointly reconstructs all of the time-frames for each slice. In 7 subjects at rest, on a 3-T scanner, the method was compared with a conventional (GRAPPA) Cartesian approach.
RESULTS: Increased slice coverage was obtained, as compared with Cartesian acquisitions. On average, 10 slices were obtained per heartbeat for radial acquisitions (8 of which are suitable for visual analysis with the remaining 2 slices, in theory, usable for quantitative purposes), whereas 4 slices were obtained for the conventional Cartesian acquisitions. The new method was robust to interframe motion, unlike using Cartesian undersampling and STCR. STCR produced images with an image quality rating (1 for best and 5 for worst) of 1.7 +/- 0.5; the Cartesian images were rated 2.6 +/- 0.4 (P = 0.0006). A mean improvement of 44 (+/-17) in signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio and 46 (+22) in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was observed for STCR.
CONCLUSION: The new radial data acquisition and reconstruction scheme for dynamic myocardial perfusion imaging is a promising approach for obtaining significantly higher coverage and improved SNR ratios. Further testing of this approach is warranted during vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease.},

	Abstract = {First-pass perfusion MRI is a promising technique to detect ischemic heart disease. Sliding window (SW) conjugate-gradient (CG) highly constrained back-projection reconstruction (HYPR) (SW-CG-HYPR) has been proposed to increase spatial coverage, spatial resolution, and SNR. However, this method is sensitive to respiratory motion and thus requires breath-hold. This work presents a non-model-based motion correction method combined with SW-CG-HYPR to perform free-breathing myocardial MR imaging. Simulation studies were first performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed motion correction method and its independence from the pattern of the respiratory motion. After that, in vivo studies were performed in six healthy volunteers. From all of the volunteer studies, the image quality score of free breathing perfusion images with motion correction (3.11 $\pm$ 0.34) is improved compared with that of images without motion correction (2.27 $\pm$ 0.32), and is comparable with that of successful breath-hold images (3.12 $\pm$ 0.38). This result was further validated by a quantitative sharpness analysis. The left ventricle and myocardium signal changes in motion corrected free-breathing perfusion images were closely correlated to those observed in breath-hold images. The correlation coefficient is 0.9764 for myocardial signals. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed the agreement between the free-breathing SW-CG-HYPR method with motion correction and the breath-hold SW-CG-HYPR.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: First-pass perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising technique for detecting ischemic heart disease. However, the diagnostic value of the method is limited by the low spatial coverage, resolution, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and cardiac motion-related image artifacts. A combination of sliding window and conjugate-gradient HighlY constrained back-PRojection reconstruction (SW-CG-HYPR) method has been proposed in healthy volunteer studies to reduce the acquisition window for each slice while maintaining the temporal resolution of 1 frame per heartbeat in myocardial perfusion MRI. This method allows for improved spatial coverage, resolution, and SNR.
METHODS: In this study, we use a controlled animal model to test whether the myocardial territory supplied by a stenotic coronary artery can be detected accurately by SW-CG-HYPR perfusion method under pharmacological stress.
RESULTS: Results from 6 mongrel dogs (15-25 kg) studies demonstrate the feasibility of SW-CG-HYPR to detect regional perfusion defects. Using this method, the acquisition time per cardiac cycle was reduced by a factor of 4, and the spatial coverage was increased from 2 to 3 slices to 6 slices as compared with the conventional techniques including both turbo-Fast Low Angle Short (FLASH) and echoplanar imaging (EPI). The SNR of the healthy myocardium at peak enhancement with SW-CG-HYPR (12.68 $\pm$ 2.46) is significantly higher (P < 0.01) than the turbo-FLASH (8.65 $\pm$ 1.93) and EPI (5.48 $\pm$ 1.24). The spatial resolution of SW-CG-HYPR images is 1.2 × 1.2 × 8.0 mm, which is better than the turbo-FLASH (1.8 × 1.8 × 8.0 mm) and EPI (2.0 × 1.8 × 8.0 mm).
CONCLUSIONS: Sliding-window CG-HYPR is a promising technique for myocardial perfusion MRI. This technique provides higher image quality with respect to significantly improved SNR and spatial resolution of the myocardial perfusion images, which might improve myocardial perfusion imaging in a clinical setting.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate an arterial spin-labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance (MR) angiographic technique that covers the entire cerebral vasculature and yields transparent-background, time-resolved hemodynamic, and vessel-specific information similar to that obtained with x-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA) without the use of exogenous contrast agents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prior institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study in which 12 healthy volunteers (five women, seven men; age range, 21-62 years; average age, 28 years) underwent imaging. An ASL technique in which variable labeling durations are used to acquire hemodynamic inflow information and a vessel-selective pulsed-continuous ASL technique were tested. Region-of-interest signal intensities in various vessel segments were averaged across subjects and used to quantitatively compare images. For comparison, a standard time of flight (TOF) acquisition was performed in the circle of Willis.
RESULTS: Inflow temporal resolution of 200 msec was demonstrated, revealing arterial transit times of 750, 950, and 1100 msec to consecutive segments of the middle cerebral artery from distal to the circle of Willis to deep regions of the midbrain. Selective labeling resulted in an average of eightfold suppression of contralateral vessels relative to the labeled vessel. Signal-to-noise ratios and contrast-to-noise ratios on maximum intensity projection images obtained with 88-second volumetric acquisitions (60 $\pm$ 15 [standard deviation] and 57 $\pm$ 15, respectively) and 11-second single-projection acquisitions (19 $\pm$ 5 and 17 $\pm$ 5, respectively) were comparable with standard TOF acquisitions, in which a 2.7-fold longer imaging duration for a 2.6-fold lower pixel area was used. Normal variations of the vasculature were identified with ASL angiography.
CONCLUSION: ASL angiography can be used to acquire hemodynamic vessel-specific information similar to that obtained with x-ray DSA.},

@article{Haider:2008fk,
	Abstract = {Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) and partial Fourier techniques have been shown to reduce the acquisition time and provide high diagnostic quality images. However, for time-resolved acquisitions there is a need for both high temporal and spatial resolution. View sharing can be used to provide an increased frame rate but at the cost of acquiring spatial frequencies over a duration longer than a frame time. In this work we hypothesize that a CArtesian Projection Reconstruction-like (CAPR) technique in combination with 2D SENSE, partial Fourier, and view sharing can provide 1-2 mm isotropic resolution with sufficient temporal resolution to distinguish intracranial arterial and venous phases of contrast passage in whole-brain angiography. In doing so, the parameter of "temporal footprint" is introduced as a descriptor for characterizing and comparing time-resolved view-shared pulse sequences. It is further hypothesized that short temporal footprint sequences have higher temporal fidelity than similar sequences with longer temporal footprints. The tradeoff of temporal footprint and temporal acceleration is presented and characterized in numerical simulations. Results from 11 whole-brain contrast-enhanced MR angiography studies with the new method with SENSE acceleration factors R = 4 and 5.3 are shown to provide images of comparable or higher diagnostic quality than the unaccelerated reference.},

@article{Riederer:1988fk,
	Abstract = {A method of magnetic resonance image acquisition and reconstruction is described in which high imaging rates and fast reconstruction times are allowed. The acquisition is a modification of the basic FLASH sequence but with a restricted number N of phase encodings. The encodings are applied sequentially, periodically, and continuously. Images are formed by sliding a window of width N encodings along the acquired data and reconstructing an image for each position of the window. In general the acquisition time per image exceeds the time between successive images, and the method thus has a temporal lag. Experimental studies were performed with a dynamic phantom using 48 phase encodings and a TR of 20 ms, for an image acquisition time of about 1 s. The image display rate in the reconstructed sequence was 12.5 images/s, and the image sequence portrayed the motion of the phantom. Additional studies were done with 24 encodings. It is shown how the sliding window technique lends itself to high-speed reconstruction, with each newly acquired echo used to quickly update the image on display. The combination of the acquisition technique described and a hardware implementation of the reconstruction algorithm can result in realtime MR image acquisition and reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A critical problem in cardiovascular MRI in small rodents is adjusting the sequence acquisition to the high heart and respiratory rates. The aim of this study was to compare a retrospectively self-gated fast low angle shot navigator (RSG-FLASH) sequence with a conventional prospectively triggered (PT-FLASH) sequence for cine imaging of the ascending aorta in mice at 9.4 T.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten C57/BL6 mice were examined with a horizontal bore 9.4 Tesla MRI animal scanner using a dedicated 2 × 2 phased-array surface coil. We acquired a RSG-FLASH sequence (RSG-FLASH sequences (repetition time (TR) / echo time (TE) = 6.5/2.5 ms, flip angle (FA) = 10 degrees, field of view (FOV) = 2 × 2 cm, matrix = 384 × 384, slice thickness = 1 mm, 25 movie frames) perpendicular to the ascending aorta using the IntraGate technique. At the same position, we performed a PT-FLASH sequence (TR/TE = 6.5/2.1 ms, FA = 10 degrees, FOV = 2 × 2 cm, matrix = 384 × 384, slice thickness = 1 mm) in which the maximum number of movie frames had to be adjusted to the interval between two R-peaks (RR interval) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) with: number of frames = RR interval / TR." Cross-sectional vessel areas at end-systole (AES) and end-diastole (AED) were measured to determine the aortic strain (ΔA = (AES-AED)/AED). Two blinded readers rated the sequences for presence of flow and trigger artifacts and their influence on the depiction of the blood/vessel-wall interface. Irregularities in displaying the cardiac cycle and the overall suitability of the sequence for aortic strain evaluation were assessed using a 5-level ordinal scale. Statistical differences were analyzed using Student t test and Wilcoxon signed rank test (P < 0.05). Intra- and interobserver variability was evaluated using Bland-Altman analyses.
RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between techniques regarding the measured vessel areas (AED: P = 0.07, AES: P = 0.34), ΔA: P = 0.1). Similarly, there were no significant differences in heart (P = 0.06) and respiratory (P = 0.24) rates. The acquisition time for RSG-FLASH sequence was significantly shorter (P = 0.04). Significantly fewer flow and trigger artifacts were noted by both readers with the RSG-FLASH sequence. Likewise, both readers considered the RSG-FLASH sequence to be superior for depiction of the blood/vessel-wall interface. The RSG-FLASH sequence was also rated superior regarding irregularities in displaying the cardiac cycle and in terms of overall suitability for evaluation of AED, AES, and aortic strain (P < 0.05 each).
CONCLUSION: RSG-FLASH is preferable for cine imaging of the aorta. It provides the same quantitative data as PT-FLASH cine imaging but is less prone to flow and trigger artifacts. RSG-FLASH permits more homogeneous depiction of the cardiac cycle and is faster than the PT-FLASH sequence. PT-FLASH is more prone to misregistration of the respiratory cycle or the ECG by the external monitoring device used for acquisition. This effect may be even more pronounced in animals with disease models that are less stable in terms of heart and respiration rate during anesthesia.},

In this study we investigated the feasibility of using a method that combines sliding window and CG-HYPR methods (SW-CG-HYPR) to reduce the acquisition window for each slice while maintaining the temporal resolution of one frame per heartbeat in myocardial perfusion MRI. This method allows an increased number of slices, reduced motion artifacts, and preserves the relatively high SNR and spatial resolution of the "composite images." Results from eight volunteers demonstrate the feasibility of SW-CG-HYPR for accelerated myocardial perfusion imaging with accurate signal intensity changes of left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Using this method the acquisition time per cardiac cycle was reduced by a factor of 4 and the number of slices was increased from 3 to 8 as compared to the conventional technique. The SNR of the myocardium at peak enhancement with SW-CG-HYPR (13.83 +/- 2.60) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than the conventional turbo-FLASH protocol (8.40 +/- 1.62). Also, the spatial resolution of the myocardial perfection images was significantly improved. SW-CG-HYPR is a promising technique for myocardial perfusion MRI.},

	Abstract = {The Periodically Rotated Overlapping ParallEL Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction (PROPELLER) method for magnetic resonance imaging data acquisition and reconstruction has the highly desirable property of being able to correct for motion during the scan, making it especially useful for imaging pediatric or uncooperative patients and diffusion imaging. This method nominally supports a circular field of view (FOV), but tailoring the FOV for noncircular shapes results in more efficient, shorter scans. This article presents new algorithms for tailoring PROPELLER acquisitions to the desired FOV shape and size that are flexible and precise. The FOV design also allows for rotational motion which provides better motion correction and reduced aliasing artifacts. Some possible FOV shapes demonstrated are ellipses, ovals and rectangles, and any convex, pi-symmetric shape can be designed. Standard PROPELLER reconstruction is used with minor modifications, and results with simulated motion presented confirm the effectiveness of the motion correction with these modified FOV shapes. These new acquisition design algorithms are simple and fast enough to be computed for each individual scan. Also presented are algorithms for further scan time reductions in PROPELLER echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisitions by varying the sample spacing in two directions within each blade.},

Experimental results show that the RF labeling period affects the extent of the carotid vessels seen with STAR imaging, and the conspicuity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and fat in the STARFIRE images. Both methods were found to provide more detailed depiction of the carotid arteries than the alternative noncontrast MRA technique of time-of-flight (TOF) angiography.},

@article{Gai:2011xr,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantitate cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the entire brain using the 3D echo planar imaging (EPI) PULSAR (pulsed star labeling) technique.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PULSAR technique was modified to 1) incorporate a nonselective inversion pulse to suppress background signal; 2) to use 3D EPI acquisition; and 3) to modulate flip angle in such a manner as to minimize the blurring resulting from T1 modulation along the slice encoding direction. Computation of CBF was performed using the general kinetic model (GKM). In a series of healthy volunteers (n = 12), we first investigated the effects of introducing an inversion pulse on the measured value of CBF and on the temporal stability of the perfusion signal. Next we investigated the effect of flip angle modulation on the spatial blurring of the perfusion signal. Finally, we evaluated the repeatability of the CBF measurements, including the influence of the measurement of arterial blood magnetization (a calibration factor for the GKM).
RESULTS: The sequence provides sufficient perfusion signal to achieve whole brain coverage in ≈ 5 minutes. Introduction of the inversion pulse for background suppression did not significantly affect computed CBF values, but did reduce the fluctuation in the perfusion signal. Flip angle modulation reduced blurring, resulting in higher estimates of gray matter (GM) CBF and lower estimates of white matter (WM) CBF. The repeatability study showed that measurement of arterial blood signal did not result in significantly higher error in the perfusion measurement.
CONCLUSION: Improvements in acquisition and sequence preparation presented here allow for better quantification and localization of perfusion signal, allowing for accurate whole-brain CBF measurements in 5 minutes.},

	Abstract = {Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe disease that leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and right heart failure. Noninvasive methods are needed to detect changes in the pulmonary artery circulation during PAH establishment and/or treatment. Pulmonary blood flow velocity can be evaluated by dynamic MR angiography, although the relevance of such data in the context of PAH remains to be demonstrated. A novel dynamic MR angiography technique was used in this work to measure blood flow velocity in the pulmonary arteries of the same living animals, before and after the establishment of chronic hypoxia-induced PAH. Chronic hypoxia decreased significantly the blood flow velocity (43.8 $\pm$ 4.9 vs 24.3 $\pm$ 8.7  cm/s) on electrocardiography-triggered time-resolved angiograms. In parallel, chronic hypoxia-induced PAH was confirmed from invasive measurements of the mean pulmonary arterial pressure (32.1 $\pm$ 4.8 vs 12.5 $\pm$ 2.2 mmHg) and the ratio of the right ventricle weight to the left ventricle plus septum weight (Fulton index: 0.54 $\pm$ 0.06 vs 0.27 $\pm$ 0.04). This study demonstrates the potential interest of dynamic MR angiography for the investigation of experimental models and for the evaluation of treatment efficacy.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterise the effects of high-salt diet (HSD) on left ventricular (LV) mass, systolic function and coronary reserve in living mice using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: Thirty C57BL/6 1-month-old female mice were fed either a control (n = 15) or an HSD (n = 15). After 3 months, LV volumes, ejection fraction and mass were assessed using time-resolved three-dimensional (3D) black-blood manganese-enhanced MRI, and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) was assessed using dynamic MR angiography at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperaemia. Hearts were excised to assess LV wet mass and micro-vascular remodelling at histology.
RESULTS: Micro-vascular remodelling was found at histology in all investigated hearts from the HSD group and none from the control group. No difference between the HSD and control groups was found in terms of heart weight, LV volumes and ejection fraction. Heart to body weight ratio was higher in the HSD group (4.39 $\pm$ 0.24 vs 4.02 $\pm$ 0.16 mg/g, P < 0.001), because of lower body weight (22.3 $\pm$ 0.9 vs 24.0 $\pm$ 1.4 g, P < 0.001). CFVR was lower in the HSD group (1.73 $\pm$ 0.11 vs 1.94 $\pm$ 0.12, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotyping of hypertensive heart disease is feasible in living mice using dynamic MR angiography and time-resolved 3D black-blood manganese-enhanced MRI. HSD is associated with early impairment of coronary reserve, before the onset of significant hypertrophy.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods with good spatial and contrast resolution are often too slow to follow the uptake of contrast agents with the desired temporal resolution. Imaging can be accelerated by skipping the acquisition of data normally taken with strong phase-encoding gradients, restricting acquisition to weak-gradient data only. If the usual procedure of substituting zeroes for the missing data is followed, blurring results. Substituting instead reference data taken before or well after contrast agent injection reduces this problem. Volunteer and patient images obtained by using such reference data show that imaging can be usefully accelerated severalfold. Cortical and medullary regions of interest and whole kidney regions were studied, and both gradient- and spin-echo images are shown. The method is believed to be compatible with other acceleration methods such as half-Fourier reconstruction and reading of more than one line of k space per excitation.},

This technique combines and extends to 3D imaging several previously published elements. These elements include an increased sampling rate for lower spatial frequencies, temporal interpolation of k-space views, and zero-filling in the slice-encoding dimension. When appropriately combined, these elements permit reconstruction of a series of 3D image sets having an effective temporal frame rate of one volume every 2-6 s. Acquiring a temporal series of images offers advantages over the current contrast-enhanced 3D MRA techniques in that it I) increases the likelihood that an arterial-only 3D image set will be obtained. II) permits the passage of the contrast agent to be observed, and III) allows temporal-processing techniques to be applied to yield additional information, or improve image quality.},

	Abstract = {In the last decade contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) has gained wide acceptance as a valuable tool in the diagnostic work-up of patients with peripheral arterial disease. This review presents current concepts in peripheral CE-MRA with emphasis on MRI technique and contrast agents. Peripheral CE-MRA is defined as an MR angiogram of the arteries from the aortic bifurcation to the feet. Advantages of CE-MRA include minimal invasiveness and lack of ionizing radiation. The basic technique employed for peripheral CE-MRA is the bolus-chase method. With this method a paramagnetic MRI contrast agent is injected intravenously and T1-weighted images are acquired in the subsequent arterial first-pass phase. In order to achieve high quality MR angiograms without interfering venous contamination or artifacts, a number of factors need to be taken into account. This includes magnetic field strength of the MRI system, receiver coil configuration, use of parallel imaging, contrast bolus timing technique, and k-space filling strategies. Furthermore, it is possible to optimize peripheral CE-MRA using venous compression techniques, hybrid scan protocols, time-resolved imaging, and steady-state MRA. Gadolinium(Gd)-based contrast agents are used for CE-MRA of the peripheral arteries. Extracellular Gd agents have a pharmacokinetic profile similar to iodinated contrast media. Accordingly, these agents are employed for first-pass MRA. Blood-pool Gd-based agents are characterized by prolonged intravascular stay, due to macromolecular structure or protein binding. These agents can be used for first-pass, as well as steady-state MRA. Some Gd-based contrast agents with low thermodynamic stability have been linked to development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with severe renal insufficiency. Using optimized technique and a stable MRI contrast agent, peripheral CE-MRA is a safe procedure with diagnostic accuracy close to that of conventional catheter X-ray angiography.},

	Abstract = {A time-resolved spin-labeled cineangiographic MRI technique for visualizing blood flow in the heart and defects of the atrial septum is described. The method utilizes a spin labeling preparation and a time-resolved balanced steady-state free precession imaging readout that enhances blood in the left atrium or right atrium and suppresses background signal through inversion recovery. Four volunteer studies and 10 patient studies were performed at 1.5 T to characterize the signal properties and to test the clinical feasibility of depicting atrial septal defects. In volunteers, the spin-labeled cineangiographic method depicted intracardiac blood flow patterns and demarcated the intact atrial septum. Peak target to adjacent atrial chamber contrast-to-noise ratios of 84 and 94 were obtained 758 and 689 ms postlabeling; 50% of peak contrast-to-noise ratio was maintained for 803 and 599 ms in the left atrium and right atrium, respectively. In all patients with an atrial septal defect, the spin-labeled cineangiographic method demonstrated left-to-right flow and maintained good morphological assessment of surrounding cardiac structures. Right-to-left flow was seen in three patients. In conclusion, the spin-labeled cineangiographic method displayed favorable signal properties in volunteers and demonstrated shunting in patients with atrial septal defects. The technique is expected to be a viable alternative to the few techniques available for visualizing blood flow in the heart.},

	Abstract = {In vivo imaging technologies are presently receiving considerable attention in the biomedical and pharmaceutical research areas. One of the principal imaging modalities is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The multiparametric nature of MRI enables anatomical, functional and even molecular information to be obtained non-invasively from intact organisms at high spatial resolution. Here we describe the use of one MRI modality, namely angiography (MRA), to non-invasively study the arterial vascular architecture of APP23 transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease. Because the spatial resolution of the technique is limited, the in vivo studies are complemented by a powerful analysis of the vasculature using vascular corrosion casting. Both techniques revealed age-dependent blood flow alterations and cerebrovascular abnormalities in these mice. Our experience suggests that MRA complemented by cast analysis are important tools to describe vascular alterations and test new therapy concepts in animal models of AD. Furthermore, being non-invasive, MRA can also be applied to studies in patients suffering from this disease.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To establish high-resolution magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) protocols to monitor and quantify dynamic changes of vascular remodeling in pathologic mouse models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Time-of-flight (TOF) MRA of murine vessels was performed at 9.4T to monitor temporal alterations in the vessel structure in two frequently used injury models (wire denudation of carotid artery and femoral artery occlusion). Quantification of vessel morphology was performed with the use of in-house-developed software and validated by estimation of inter- and intraobserver variabilities and reproducibility, and by correlation with histological data.
RESULTS: MRA-based volume determination exhibited low intra- and interobserver variabilities and high reproducibility. Furthermore, good correlations with histological data were found four weeks after injury (R2=0.970). Two high-resolution image series are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the technique: 1) the time course of a vessel stenosis that reopens by thrombus recanalization, and 2) the continuous restoration of blood flow by collateral vessel formation during arteriogenesis after induction of hindlimb ischemia.
CONCLUSION: We describe high-resolution MRA imaging protocols that are suitable for sensitively measuring the extent and time course of changes in vessel morphology in mice in a repetitive manner without any contrast agent. This methodology provides a reliable tool for noninvasive monitoring of vascular lesion development or neovascularization in transgenic mice.},

	Abstract = {The ability of gene targeting in the mouse species presents a powerful tool to determine the role of specific molecules in vascular biology. Using a denuding-injury procedure, we recently reported that intimal lesions can be induced in the carotid artery of outbred mice. The technical challenge associated with achieving complete denudation and the relatively small size of the developing lesions prompted us to design the present model of neointima formation and vascular remodeling in the carotid artery of the inbred FVB mouse strain. Complete ligation of the vessel near the carotid bifurcation induced rapid proliferation of medial smooth muscle cells, leading to extensive neointima formation in the presence of an endothelial lining. Thrombus formation was not observed except in the most distal part of the vessel adjacent to the ligature. At 4 weeks after ligation, luminal area was reduced by approximately 80% through a combination of decreased vessel diameter and neointima formation. Ultrastructural analysis provided evidence for cell death in the developing neointima as well as the remodeling media. The present model might be useful in identifying those genes important for neointima formation and vascular remodeling.},

	Abstract = {Catecholamine stimulation of alpha1-adrenoceptors exerts growth factor-like activity, mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species, on arterial smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts and contributes to hypertrophy and hyperplasia in models of vascular injury and disease. Adrenergic trophic activity also contributes to flow-mediated positive arterial remodeling by augmenting proliferation and leukocyte accumulation. To further examine this concept, we studied whether catecholamines contribute to collateral growth and angiogenesis in hindlimb insufficiency. Support for this hypothesis includes the above-mentioned studies, evidence that ischemia augments norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves, and proposed involvement of reactive oxygen species in angiogenesis and collateral growth. Mice deficient in catecholamine synthesis [by gene deletion of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH-/-)] were studied. At 3 wk after femoral artery ligation, increases in adductor muscle perfusion were similar in DBH-/- and wild-type mice, whereas recovery of plantar perfusion and calf microsphere flow were attenuated, although not significantly. Preexisting collaterals in adductor of wild-type mice showed increases in lumen diameter (60%) and medial and adventitial thickness (57 and 119%, P < 0.05 here and below). Lumen diameter increased similarly in DBH-/- mice (52%); however, increases in medial and adventitial thicknesses were reduced (30 and 65%). Leukocyte accumulation in the adventitia/periadventitia of collaterals was 39% less in DBH-/- mice. Increased density of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive vessels in wild-type adductor (45%) was inhibited in DBH-/- mice (2%). Although both groups experienced similar atrophy in the gastrocnemius (approximately 22%), the increase in capillary-to-muscle fiber ratio in wild-type mice (21%) was inhibited in DBH-/- mice (7%). These data suggest that catecholamines may contribute to collateral growth and angiogenesis in tissue ischemia.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are known elastolytic mediators of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) degeneration, and their activity is tightly regulated by the presence of tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs). Imbalances in this system may be instrumental in compromising arterial wall integrity. The aim of this study was to show that, in an elastase-induced murine model of aneurysm formation, TIMP-1 has a protective effect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four wild-type (TIMP-1+/+) and 22 knockout (TIMP-1-/-) mice underwent laparotomy and isolation of the infrarenal aorta. A polyethylene catheter was inserted into the aorta and dilute pancreatic elastase (0.39 Units/ml) was infused over 5 min using a perfusion pump. Pre- and postinfusion maximal aortic diameters were obtained in triplicate for each animal using NIH Image. Final aortic measurements were obtained 14 days later, prior to perfusion fixation with 10% buffered Formalin. Aortic specimens were sectioned and stained. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test.
RESULTS: TIMP-1-/- mice demonstrated a significant postinfusion diameter increase compared to wild-types after elastase, which was not seen after saline infusion. At sacrifice, TIMP-1-/- mice, following both saline and elastase infusion, showed a significant increase in maximal aortic diameter relative to postinfusion measurements compared to TIMP-1+/+ mice.
CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1-/- mice develop larger aneurysms than TIMP-1+/+ mice. This study illustrates the protective effects of TIMP-1 in an experimental AAA model and may provide a means for pharmacologically controlling aneurysm growth.},

	Abstract = {Our purpose was to further improve the target volume definition for radiosurgical treatment of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) by means of dynamic MRA (dMRA) using a blood bolus tagging sequence. We therefore compare this technique with 3D-TOF-MRA and transfemoral high resolution angiography in plain film technique. Twenty patients with angiographically proven cerebral AVMs were investigated by dMRA, TOF-MRA, and conventional angiography during the MR-assisted radiosurgical planning protocol. The patient's head was fixed in an MR-compatible stereotactic device. The different angiography techniques were evaluated by consensus of two radiologists. AVMs were characterized by the number and origin of feeding arteries, the maximum diameter of the AVM nidus, and the venous drainage pattern. Dynamic MRA was able to demonstrate the complete AVM characteristics and hemodynamics in 12 out of 20 patients. In three patients with an AVM nidus smaller than 1 cm in diameter the technique could not reliably depict the malformation. Technical problems due to steel screws and pins in the initially used stereotactic frame occurred in five patients. Due to reduced vessel overlap and the lack of disturbances caused by formations with short T1 time, dMRA was superior to TOF-MRA in the detection and the exact localization of the AVM nidus in four patients. We conclude that dMRA is able to demonstrate reliably AVM characteristics and hemodynamics in AVMs with a nidus larger than 1 cm in diameter. Because of the improved demarcation of the AVM nidus, this technique may be a valuable adjunct to radiosurgery planning of cerebral AVMs.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A reliable quantitative technique for measuring arteriovenous (AV) shunt in vascular malformations is not currently available. Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that continuous arterial spin-labeled (CASL) perfusion MR imaging can be used to detect and measure AV shunt in patients with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CASL perfusion MR imaging was performed in 7 patients with AVMs. Semiquantitative AV shunt estimates were generated based on a thresholding strategy by using signal-intensity difference (DeltaM) images to avoid potential errors in cerebral blood flow (CBF) calculation related to abnormal transit times and nonphysiologic blood-tissue water exchange in and around the AVMs. The potential for measuring CBF in regions distant from and near the AVM was explored, as was the relationship of CBF changes related to the size of the shunt.
RESULTS: In all 7 cases, striking increased intensity was seen on CASL perfusion DeltaM maps in the nidus and venous structures draining the AVM. Shunt estimates ranged from 30% to 0.6%. Mean CBF measurements in structures near the AVMs were not significantly different from the contralateral measurements. However, CBF in adjacent ipsilateral white matter increased relative to the contralateral side as the percent shunt increased (P = .02). Cortical gray matter CBF Delta (contralateral-ipsilateral) values demonstrated the same effect, but the correlation was weak and not significant. Thalamic CBF decreased ipsilaterally with increasing percent AV shunt (P = .01), indicating a possible steal effect. Basal ganglia Delta values showed little change in CBF with the size of the AV shunt.
CONCLUSION: CASL perfusion MR imaging can demonstrate AV shunting, providing high lesion conspicuity and a novel means for evaluating AVM physiology.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To obtain diffusion tensor images (DTI) over a large image volume rapidly with 3D isotropic spatial resolution, minimal spatial distortions, and reduced motion artifacts, a diffusion-weighted steady-state 3D projection (SS 3DPR) pulse sequence was developed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A diffusion gradient was inserted in a SS 3DPR pulse sequence. The acquisition was synchronized to the cardiac cycle, linear phase errors were corrected along the readout direction, and each projection was weighted by measures of consistency with other data. A new iterative parallel imaging reconstruction method was also implemented for removing off-resonance and undersampling artifacts simultaneously.
RESULTS: The contrast and appearance of both the fractional anisotropy and eigenvector color maps were substantially improved after all correction techniques were applied. True 3D DTI datasets were obtained in vivo over the whole brain (240 mm field of view in all directions) with 1.87 mm isotropic spatial resolution, six diffusion encoding directions in under 19 minutes.
CONCLUSION: A true 3D DTI pulse sequence with high isotropic spatial resolution was developed for whole brain imaging in under 20 minutes. To minimize the effects of brain motion, a cardiac synchronized, multiecho, DW-SSFP pulse sequence was implemented. Motion artifacts were further reduced by a combination of linear phase correction, corrupt projection detection and rejection, sampling density reweighting, and parallel imaging reconstruction. The combination of these methods greatly improved the quality of 3D DTI in the brain.},

	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) of the spine requires robust imaging methods, that are insensitive to susceptibility effects caused by the transition from bone to soft tissue and motion artifacts due to breathing, swallowing, and cardiac motion. The purpose of this study was to develop a robust imaging method suitable for DWI of the spine.
METHODS AND SUBJECTS: A radial k-space spin echo sequence has been implemented, which is self-navigating because each acquisition line passes through the origin of k-space. Influence of cardiac motion and associated flow of cerebrospinal fluid is minimized by cardiac gating with a finger photoplethysmograph. The sequence has been tested on a 1.5T system. Diffusion-weighted images of six normal volunteers were acquired in the sagittal plane with 4 b values between 50 and 500 s mm(-2). Because of the symmetries of the cord, diffusion measurements in the head-foot (HF) or left-right (LR) directions were sufficient to measure the dominant effects of anisotropy.
RESULTS: The apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) measured, respectively, in the LR and HF directions were (0.699+/-0.050)x10(-3) and (1.805+/-0.086)x10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) in the spinal cord, (1.588+/-0.082)x10(-3) and (1.528+/-0.052)x10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) in the intervertebral disks, and (0.346+/-0.047)x10(-3) and (0.306+/-0.035)x10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) in the vertebrae of the cervicothoracic spine.
CONCLUSION: Diffusion-weighted spin echo sequences with radial trajectories in k-space provide a means of achieving robust, high quality diffusion-weighted imaging and measuring ADCs in the spine. The application of the diffusion-weighting gradients in different directions allows diffusion anisotropy to be measured.},

	Abstract = {While most diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is acquired using single-shot diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar imaging, steady-state DWI is an alternative method with the potential to achieve higher-resolution images with less distortion. Steady-state DWI is, however, best suited to a segmented three-dimensional acquisition and thus requires three-dimensional navigation to fully correct for motion artifacts. In this paper, a method for three-dimensional motion-corrected steady-state DWI is presented. The method uses a unique acquisition and reconstruction scheme named trajectory using radially batched internal navigator echoes (TURBINE). Steady-state DWI with TURBINE uses slab-selection and a short echo-planar imaging (EPI) readout each pulse repetition time. Successive EPI readouts are rotated about the phase-encode axis. For image reconstruction, batches of cardiac-synchronized readouts are used to form three-dimensional navigators from a fully sampled central k-space cylinder. In vivo steady-state DWI with TURBINE is demonstrated in human brain. Motion artifacts are corrected using refocusing reconstruction and TURBINE images prove less distorted compared to two-dimensional single-shot diffusion-weighted-spin-EPI.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to develop a new method for free-breathing contrast-enhanced multiphase liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a combination of compressed sensing, parallel imaging, and radial k-space sampling and to demonstrate the feasibility of this method by performing image quality comparison with breath-hold cartesian T1-weighted (conventional) postcontrast acquisitions in healthy participants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study received approval from the institutional review board. Eight participants underwent 3 separate contrast-enhanced fat-saturated T1-weighted gradient-echo MRI examinations with matching imaging parameters: conventional breath-hold examination with cartesian k-space sampling volumetric interpolate breath hold examination (BH-VIBE) and free-breathing acquisitions with interleaved angle-bisection and continuous golden-angle radial sampling schemes. Interleaved angle-bisection and golden-angle data from each 100 consecutive spokes were reconstructed using a combination of compressed sensing and parallel imaging (interleaved-angle radial sparse parallel [IARASP] and golden-angle radial sparse parallel [GRASP]) to generate multiple postcontrast phases.Arterial- and venous-phase BH-VIBE, IARASP, and GRASP reconstructions were evaluated by 2 radiologists in a blinded fashion. The readers independently assessed quality of enhancement (QE), overall image quality (IQ), and other parameters of image quality on a 5-point scale, with the highest score indicating the most desirable examination. Mixed model analysis of variance was used to compare each measure of image quality.
RESULTS: Images of BH-VIBE and GRASP had significantly higher QE and IQ values compared with IARASP for both phases (P < 0.05). The differences in QE between BH-VIBE and GRASP for the arterial and venous phases were not significant (P > 0.05). Although GRASP had lower IQ score compared with BH-VIBE for the arterial (3.9 vs 4.8; P < 0.0001) and venous (4.2 vs 4.8; P = 0.005) phases, GRASP received IQ scores of 3 or more in all participants, which was consistent with acceptable or better diagnostic image quality.
CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced multiphase liver MRI of diagnostic quality can be performed during free breathing using a combination of compressed sensing, parallel imaging, and golden-angle radial sampling.},

	Abstract = {Phase contrast velocimetry can be utilized to measure complex flow for both quantitative and qualitative assessment of vascular hemodynamics. However, phase contrast requires that a maximum measurable velocity be set that balances noise and phase aliasing. To efficiently reduce noise in phase contrast images, several investigators have proposed extended velocity encoding schemes that use extra encodings to unwrap phase aliasing; however, existing techniques can lead to significant increases in echo and scan time, limiting their clinical benefits. In this work, we have developed a novel five-point velocity encoding scheme that efficiently reduces noise with minimal increases in scan and echo time. Investigations were performed in phantoms, demonstrating a 63% increase in velocity-to-noise ratio compared to standard four-point encoding schemes. Aortic velocity measurements were performed in healthy volunteers, showing similar velocity-to-noise ratio improvements. In those volunteers, it was also demonstrated that, without sacrificing accuracy, low-resolution images can be used for the fifth encoding point, reducing the scan time penalty from 25% down to less than 1%.},

	Abstract = {Pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) can be used to generate noncontrast magnetic resonance angiograms of the cerebrovascular structures. Previously described PCASL-based angiography techniques were limited to two-dimensional projection images or relatively low-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging due to long acquisition time. This work proposes a new PCASL-based 3D magnetic resonance angiography method that uses an accelerated 3D radial acquisition technique (VIPR, spoiled gradient echo) as the readout. Benefiting from the sparsity provided by PCASL and noise-like artifacts of VIPR, this new method is able to obtain submillimeter 3D isotropic resolution and whole head coverage with a 8-min scan. Intracranial angiography feasibility studies in healthy (N = 5) and diseased (N = 5) subjects show reduced saturation artifacts in PCASL-VIPR compared with a standard time-of-flight protocol. These initial results show great promise for PCASL-VIPR for static, dynamic, and vessel selective 3D intracranial angiography.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to discuss nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in detail regarding its history, possible pathophysiology, clinical and pathologic presentations, diagnosis, and implications for the radiology community.
CONCLUSION: NSF is a potentially lethal disorder that occurs in patients with reduced kidney function. Current evidence suggests a strong association with gadolinium-based contrast agents--mostly used in MRI--in this patient group. This has urged the radiology community to emphasize careful screening for the presence of renal dysfunction among patients for whom gadolinium-enhanced MRI is contemplated. Appropriate selection of gadolinium-based contrast agent type, avoidance of nonstandard dosage, patient education, and informed consent have been recommended by authorities.},

	Abstract = {Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography is challenging due to the need for both high spatial and temporal resolution. A multishot trajectory composed of pseudo-random rotations of a single multiecho radial readout was developed. The trajectory is designed to give incoherent aliasing artifacts and a relatively uniform distribution of projections over all time scales. A field map (computed from the same data set) is used to avoid signal dropout in regions of substantial field inhomogeneity. A compressed sensing reconstruction using the GraDeS algorithm was used. Whole brain angiograms were reconstructed at 1-mm isotropic resolution and a 1.1-s frame rate (corresponding to an acceleration factor > 100). The only parameter which must be chosen is the number of iterations of the GraDeS algorithm. A larger number of iterations improves the temporal behavior at cost of decreased image signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting images provide a good depiction of the cerebral vasculature and have excellent arterial/venous separation.},

@article{Rapacchi:2013uq,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: We propose a compressed-sensing (CS) technique based on magnitude image subtraction for high spatial and temporal resolution dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA).
METHODS: Our technique integrates the magnitude difference image into the CS reconstruction to promote subtraction sparsity. Fully sampled Cartesian 3D CE-MRA datasets from 6 volunteers were retrospectively under-sampled and three reconstruction strategies were evaluated: k-space subtraction CS, independent CS, and magnitude subtraction CS. The techniques were compared in image quality (vessel delineation, image artifacts, and noise) and image reconstruction error. Our CS technique was further tested on seven volunteers using a prospectively under-sampled CE-MRA sequence.
RESULTS: Compared with k-space subtraction and independent CS, our magnitude subtraction CS provides significantly better vessel delineation and less noise at 4× acceleration, and significantly less reconstruction error at 4× and 8× (P < 0.05 for all). On a 1-4 point image quality scale in vessel delineation, our technique scored 3.8 $\pm$ 0.4 at 4×, 2.8 $\pm$ 0.4 at 8×, and 2.3 $\pm$ 0.6 at 12× acceleration. Using our CS sequence at 12× acceleration, we were able to acquire dynamic CE-MRA with higher spatial and temporal resolution than current clinical TWIST protocol while maintaining comparable image quality (2.8 $\pm$ 0.5 vs. 3.0 $\pm$ 0.4, P = NS).
CONCLUSION: Our technique is promising for dynamic CE-MRA. Magn Reson Med, 2013. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{AlMuhanna:2012fk,
	Abstract = {Stroke is the second leading cause of death in the world, and one of the major causes of disability. Approximately 30% of ischemic strokes are due to plaque rupture in the carotid arteries. The most popular diagnostic method uses Doppler ultrasound to find the percent stenosis. However, other factors, such as the hemodynamics around the plaque may play a larger role in identifying the risk of plaque rupture. It has been shown previously in simulations that non-collateral flow in the circle of Willis (COW) could cause an increase of the intraluminal velocity around carotid plaque. This added strain may increase the vulnerability of the plaque to rupture. We investigated asymmetries in flow waveforms in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis. We compared clinical results of velocity waveforms in the MCA, acquired using transcranial Doppler (TCD), with a simple linear simulation model of the intra- and extracranial arterial network to investigate the relationship between contralateral and ipsilateral flow profiles in the MCA for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. In 17 out of 23 patients we found waveforms consistent with those predicted for a collateralized COW, with minimal differences in delay, velocity magnitude and resistivity index. In 6 cases, some unexpected findings were noted, such as large delays for 2 patients ≤ 50% stenosis, and a large velocity difference with low delay for 4 patients. More studies are needed to elucidate the role of incomplete intracranial collateralization on the hemodynamics around carotid plaque and to use imaging of the COW to corroborate our results.},

	Abstract = {T1, T2, and magnetization transfer (MT) measurements were performed in vitro at 3 T and 37 degrees C on a variety of tissues: mouse liver, muscle, and heart; rat spinal cord and kidney; bovine optic nerve, cartilage, and white and gray matter; and human blood. The MR parameters were compared to those at 1.5 T. As expected, the T2 relaxation time constants and quantitative MT parameters (MT exchange rate, R, macromolecular pool fraction, M0B, and macromolecular T2 relaxation time, T2B) at 3 T were similar to those at 1.5 T. The T1 relaxation time values, however, for all measured tissues increased significantly with field strength. Consequently, the phenomenological MT parameter, magnetization transfer ratio, MTR, was lower by approximately 2 to 10%. Collectively, these results provide a useful reference for optimization of pulse sequence parameters for MRI at 3 T.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential of a new dynamic MRA sequence (DynAngio) based on arterial spin labeling for the assessment of intracranial collateral flow.
METHODS: Twelve patients with unilateral internal carotid artery obstruction were investigated. Different patterns of collateral flow were compared between DynAngio, transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasound, and time-of-flight MRA.
RESULTS: There was a good agreement between the methods, with sensitivities between 80% and 90%. Small collateral vessels were detected more frequently with DynAngio compared to time-of-flight MRA.
CONCLUSIONS: DynAngio provides anatomic and similar to transcranial color-coded duplex ultrasound functional information on collateral flow for the assessment of intracranial hemodynamics.},

	Abstract = {Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) has become an important tool for small animal cardiac imaging. In relation to competing technologies (microCT and ultrasound), MR is limited by spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and acquisition time. All three of these limitations have been addressed by developing a four-dimensional (4D) (3D plus time) radial acquisition (RA) sequence. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has been optimized by minimizing the echo time (TE) (300 us). The temporal resolution and throughput have been improved by center-out trajectories resulting in repetition time (TR) <2.5 ms. The contrast has been enhanced through the use of a liposomal blood pool agent that reduces the T(1) of the blood to <400 ms. We have developed protocols for three specific applications: 1) high-throughput with spatial resolution of 87 x 87 x 352 um(3) (voxel volume = 2.7 nL) and acquisition time of 16 min; 2) high-temporal resolution with spatial resolution of 87 x 87 x 352 um(3) (voxel volume = 2.7 nL) and temporal resolution at 4.8 ms and acquisition time of 32 minutes; and 3) high-resolution isotropic imaging at 87 x 87 x 87 um(3) (voxel volume = 0.68 nL) and acquisition time of 31 min. The 4D image arrays allow direct measure of cardiac functional parameters dependent on chamber volumes, e.g., ejection fraction (EF), end diastolic volume (EDV), and end systolic volume (ESV).},

	Abstract = {A new approach to autocalibrating, coil-by-coil parallel imaging reconstruction, is presented. It is a generalized reconstruction framework based on self-consistency. The reconstruction problem is formulated as an optimization that yields the most consistent solution with the calibration and acquisition data. The approach is general and can accurately reconstruct images from arbitrary k-space sampling patterns. The formulation can flexibly incorporate additional image priors such as off-resonance correction and regularization terms that appear in compressed sensing. Several iterative strategies to solve the posed reconstruction problem in both image and k-space domain are presented. These are based on a projection over convex sets and conjugate gradient algorithms. Phantom and in vivo studies demonstrate efficient reconstructions from undersampled Cartesian and spiral trajectories. Reconstructions that include off-resonance correction and nonlinear l(1)-wavelet regularization are also demonstrated.},

@article{Usman:2013qf,
	Abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) has been demonstrated to accelerate MRI acquisitions by reconstructing sparse images of good quality from highly undersampled data. Motion during MR scans can cause inconsistencies in k-space data, resulting in strong motion artifacts in the reconstructed images. For CS to be useful in these applications, motion correction techniques need to be combined with the undersampled reconstruction. Recently, joint motion correction and CS approaches have been proposed to partially correct for effects of motion. However, the main limitation of these approaches is that they can only correct for affine deformations. In this work, we propose a novel motion corrected CS framework for free-breathing dynamic cardiac MRI that incorporates a general motion correction formulation directly into the CS reconstruction. This framework can correct for arbitrary affine or nonrigid motion in the CS reconstructed cardiac images, while simultaneously benefiting from highly accelerated MR acquisition. The application of this approach is demonstrated both in simulations and in vivo data for 2D respiratory self-gated free-breathing cardiac CINE MRI, using a golden angle radial acquisition. Results show that this approach allows for the reconstruction of respiratory motion corrected cardiac CINE images with similar quality to breath-held acquisitions.},

	Abstract = {Cardiac function has traditionally been evaluated using breath-hold cine acquisitions. However, there is a great need for free breathing techniques in patients who have difficulty in holding their breath. Real-time cardiac MRI is a valuable alternative to the traditional breath-hold imaging approach, but the real-time images are often inferior in spatial and temporal resolution. This article presents a general method for reconstruction of high spatial and temporal resolution cine images from a real-time acquisition acquired over multiple cardiac cycles. The method combines parallel imaging and motion correction based on nonrigid registration and can be applied to arbitrary k-space trajectories. The method is demonstrated with real-time Cartesian imaging and Golden Angle radial acquisitions, and the motion-corrected acquisitions are compared with raw real-time images and breath-hold cine acquisitions in 10 (N = 10) subjects. Acceptable image quality was obtained in all motion-corrected reconstructions, and the resulting mean image quality score was (a) Cartesian real-time: 2.48, (b) Golden Angle real-time: 1.90 (1.00-2.50), (c) Cartesian motion correction: 3.92, (d) Radial motion correction: 4.58, and (e) Breath-hold cine: 5.00. The proposed method provides a flexible way to obtain high-quality, high-resolution cine images in patients with difficulty holding their breath.},

METHODS: Data were acquired on a 3T clinical system using 3D Golden Angle radial sampling. Two gastrointestinal catheters incorporating four fiducial 19F markers (65 or 50 µL marker volume) were tracked while being pulled through a gel phantom by an operator inside the MR room with velocities of 2-18 mm/s. During continuous acquisition, k-space profiles were transferred in real-time to an external computer for concurrent reconstruction of 3D 19F images and detection and visualization of marker positions. Based on αthe marker positions, automatic adjustments of 1H imaging planes to facilitate targeted anatomical scanning was implemented. RESULTS: Mean tracking reliabilities were 94.5 and 83.6% (catheters 1 and 2) for temporal resolutions 185-740 ms. Reconstruction times of 196 ms were achieved. Real-time visual feedback allowed the operator to accurately control the catheter movement. Catheter-guidance for 1H imaging was reliable. CONCLUSION: The presented real-time 19F MR based framework for the tracking of 19F labeled devices is applicable to combined 19F and 1H MRI guidance of gastrointestinal devices in vivo.

	Abstract = {This work presents a new class of three-dimensional spiral based-trajectories for sampling magnetic resonance data. The distributed spirals trajectory efficiently traverses a cylinder or sphere or intermediate shape in k-space. The trajectory is shown to be nearly as efficient as a conventional stack of spirals trajectory in terms of scan time and signal-to-noise ratio, while reducing coherent aliasing in all three spatial directions and reducing Gibbs ringing due to the nature of collecting data from a sphere in k-space. The trajectory uses a single two-dimensional spiral waveform with the addition of a single orthogonal waveform which is scaled with each repetition, making it relatively easy to implement. Blurring from off-resonance only occurs in two dimensions due to the temporal nature of the sampling.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Two-dimensional projection reconstruction methods provide advantages over three-dimensional techniques because of higher flexibility regarding the resolution and shorter scan time needed. To optimize a two-dimensional radial sequence with respect to signal-to-noise ratio, variable-rate selective excitation and retrospective electrocardiogram gating is investigated. METHODS: The minimal radiofrequency pulse duration is simulated in dependence of the flip angle and coil parameters using sinc waveforms with two different variable-rate selective excitation approaches and a Fermi pulse. Retrospectively electrocardiogram-gated imaging with Golden Angle incremented projections was implemented to allow for continuous data acquisition enabling the possibility of dynamic electrocardiogram-gated heart imaging. RESULTS: Especially for abdominal coils with high transmitter voltages required, variable-rate selective excitation strongly reduces the radiofrequency pulse duration and echo time resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio gain up to 15.5% (if the fast relaxation component of sodium is in the order of the radiofrequency pulse duration) compared with standard sinc-shaped radiofrequency pulses. Retrospective electrocardiogram gating shows higher flexibility with regard to the trigger delay enabling the trade-off between heart motion artifacts and signal-to-noise ratio. CONCLUSION: A two-dimensional radial sequence is optimized for sodium heart imaging regarding signal-to-noise ratio. Different sodium contrasts of the human heart are shown, which can give additional information on heart diseases. Magn Reson Med, 2012. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To combine fluorine 19 ((19)F) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and golden angle radial acquisition and to assess the feasibility of (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based tracking for catheter tracking applications and simultaneous three-dimensional (3D) intestinal tracking of ingested (19)F-labeled capsules in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Approval from the local ethical committee and informed consent from the subject were obtained. In vitro studies were performed to assess (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based tracking reliability with regard to temporal resolution and different tracking strategies (boundary condition-free tracking, composite image-based tracking, and model-based tracking). In vivo performance of the method was investigated in one healthy volunteer on 2 days. On study day 1, a duodenal catheter incorporating five (19)F-labeled capsules was administered nasally, and its 3D movement was tracked inside the stomach and esophagus. On study day 2, three (19)F-labeled capsules were swallowed, and intestinal movement was tracked.
RESULTS: Simultaneous in vivo 3D tracking of multiple (19)F-labeled capsules was successfully performed without incorporation of boundary conditions at a temporal resolution of 252 msec. Incorporation of boundary conditions with composite image-based tracking and model-based tracking increased tracking reliability and enabled temporal resolution as high as 108 msec.
CONCLUSION: Use of (19)F MR imaging golden angle-based capsule tracking enables in vivo tracking of (19)F-labeled capsules and catheters at high temporal resolution. The presented method is applicable to physioanatomic studies of the gastrointestinal tract and shows potential for real-time tracking in interventional radiology.},

	Abstract = {A promising approach for the simultaneous quantification of relative proton density (M(0)), T(1), and T(2) is the inversion-recovery TrueFISP sequence, consisting of an inversion pulse followed by a series of balanced steady-state free precession acquisitions. Parameters can then be obtained from a mono-exponential fit to the series of images. However, a segmented acquisition is usually necessary, which increases the total acquisition time considerably. The goal of this study is to obtain M(0), T(1), and T(2) maps using a single-shot acquisition, with T(1) and T(2) measurements in brain that are consistent with the published literature, with a 20-fold speed improvement over the segmented approach, and at a clinically relevant spatial resolution. To this end, a single-shot inversion-recovery TrueFISP sequence was combined with a radial view-sharing technique. The parameters M(0), T(1), and T(2) were then obtained on a pixel-wise basis from a three fit parameter to the signal evolution. The accuracy of this method for quantifying these parameters is demonstrated in vivo. In addition, further corrections to the quantification necessary owing to other experimental factors, namely magnetization transfer and imperfect slice profiles, were developed. Including additional scans necessary for these corrections in the measurement protocol, the required scan time is increased from approximately 6 to 18-28 s per slice.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI is becoming an increasingly important tool for evaluating tumor vascularity and assessing the effectiveness of emerging antiangiogenic and antivascular agents. In chest and abdominal regions, however, respiratory motion can seriously degrade the achievable image quality in DCE-MRI studies. The purpose of this work is to develop a respiratory motion-compensated DCE-MRI technique that combines the self-gating properties of radial imaging with the reconstruction flexibility afforded by the golden-angle view-order strategy. Following radial data acquisition, the signal at k-space center is first used to determine the respiratory cycle, and consecutive views during the expiratory phase of each respiratory period (34-55 views, depending on the breathing rate) are grouped into individual segments. Residual intrasegment translation of lesion is subsequently compensated for by an autofocusing technique that optimizes image entropy, while intersegment translation (among different respiratory cycles) is corrected using 3D image correlation. The resulting motion-compensated, undersampled dynamic image series is then processed to reduce image streaking and to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to perfusion analysis, using either the k-space-weighted image contrast (KWIC) radial filtering technique or principal component analysis (PCA). The proposed data acquisition scheme also allows for high frame-rate arterial input function (AIF) sampling and free-breathing baseline T(1) mapping. The performance of the proposed radial DCE-MRI technique is evaluated in subjects with lung and liver lesions, and results demonstrate that excellent pixelwise perfusion maps can be obtained with the proposed methodology.},

	Abstract = {A shortcoming of current coronary MRA methods with thin-slab 3D acquisitions is the time-consuming examination necessitated by extensive scout scanning and precise slice planning. To improve ease of use and cover larger parts of the anatomy, it appears desirable to image the entire heart with high spatial resolution instead. For this purpose, an isotropic 3D-radial acquisition was employed in this study. This method allows undersampling of k-space in all three spatial dimensions, and its insensitivity to motion enables extended acquisitions per cardiac cycle. We present initial phantom and in vivo results obtained in volunteers that demonstrate large volume coverage with high isotropic spatial resolution. We were able to visualize all major parts of the coronary arteries retrospectively from the volume data set without compromising the image quality. The scan time ranged from 10 to 14 min during free breathing at a heart rate of 60 bpm, which is comparable to that of a thin-slab protocol comprising multiple scans for each coronary artery.},

	Abstract = {(23)Na MRI has the potential to noninvasively detect sodium (Na) content changes in vivo. The goal of this study was to implement (23)Na MRI in a clinical setting for neurooncological and muscular imaging. Due to the biexponential T(2) decay of the tissue Na signal with a short component, which ranges between 0.5-8 ms, the measurement of total Na content requires imaging techniques with echo times (TEs) below 0.5 ms. A 3D radial pulse sequence with a TE of 0.2 ms at a spatial resolution of 4 x 4 x 4 mm(3) was developed that allows the acquisition and presentation of Na images on the scanner. This sequence was evaluated in patients with low- and high-grade gliomas, and higher (23)Na MR signals corresponding to an increased Na content were found in the tumor regions. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between tumor and white matter increased from 0.8 +/- 0.2 to 1.3 +/- 0.3 with tumor grade. In patients with an identified muscular (23)Na channelopathy (Paramyotonia congenita (PC)), induced muscle weakness led to a signal increase of approximately 18% in the (23)Na MR images, which was attributed to intracellular Na(+) accumulation in this region.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test a four-dimensional (4D) dark-blood magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method based on a radial sampling trajectory capable of displaying the human arterial wall and its motion in three spatial dimensions over the cardiac cycle.
METHODS: The carotid arteries of volunteer and patient subjects were imaged with the proposed 4D dark-blood MRI sequence on a 3T scanner. Validation of arterial lumen and arterial wall areas obtained with the proposed 4D dark-blood technique was made with respect to established two-dimensional bright-blood cine and high spatial resolution three-dimensional dark-blood MRI protocols, respectively.
RESULTS: The proposed 4D MRI method provided for dark-blood display of the carotid arterial wall and demonstrated its movement and distension over the cardiac cycle. Quantitative measurements of arterial lumen and wall areas were in statistical agreement with established MRI techniques.
CONCLUSION: 4D blood suppressed MRI of the human vascular system with submillimeter isotropic spatial resolution is feasible in a clinically reasonable scan time, and data obtained in the carotid arteries show good agreement with established MRI techniques. Future efforts will examine the constellation of data provided by the method and investigate its utility for assessing cardiovascular risk.},

	Abstract = {Segmented cine MRI generally requires breath-holding, which can be problematic for many patients. Navigator echo techniques, particularly successful for free-breathing coronary MRA, are incompatible with the acquisition strategies and SSFP pulse sequences commonly used for cine MRI. The purpose of this work is to introduce a new self-gating technique deriving respiratory gating information directly from the raw imaging data acquired for segmented cine MRI. The respiratory self-gating technique uses interleaved radial k-space sampling to provide low-resolution images in real time during the free-breathing acquisition that are compared to target expiration images. Only the raw data-producing images with high correlation to the target images are included in the final high-resolution reconstruction. The self-gating technique produced cine series with no significant differences in quantitative image sharpness to series produced using comparable breath-held techniques. Because of the difficulties associated with breath-holding, the respiratory self-gating technique represents an important practical advance for cardiac MRI. , Inc.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to introduce a new noncontrast enhanced 4D dynamic MR angiography (dMRA) technique termed multibolus TrueFISP-based spin tagging with alternating radiofrequency (TrueSTAR). METHODS: Multibolus TrueFISP-based spin tagging with alternating radiofrequency was developed by taking advantage of the phenomenon that the steady-state signal of TrueFISP is minimally disturbed by periodically inserted magnetization preparations (e.g., spin tagging) that are sandwiched by two α/2 RF pulses. Both theoretical analysis and experimental studies were carried out to optimize the proposed method which was compared with both pulsed and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling-based dMRA in healthy volunteers. Optimized multibolus dMRA was also applied in a patient with arteriovenous malformation to demonstrate its potential clinical utility. RESULTS: Multibolus dMRA offered a prolonged tagging bolus compared to the standard single-bolus dMRA, and allowed improved visualization of the draining veins in the arteriovenous malformation patient. Compared to pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling-based dMRA, multibolus dMRA provided visualization of the full passage of the labeled blood with the flexibility for both static and dynamic magnetic resonance angiography. CONCLUSION: By combining the benefits of pulsed and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling-based dMRA, multibolus TrueFISP-based spin tagging with alternating radiofrequency can prolong and enhance the tagging bolus without sacrificing imaging speed or temporal resolution.

	Abstract = {A novel center-out 3D trajectory for sampling magnetic resonance data is presented. The trajectory set is based on a single Fermat spiral waveform, which is substantially undersampled in the center of k-space. Multiple trajectories are combined in a "stacked cone" configuration to give very uniform sampling throughout a "hub," which is very efficient in terms of gradient performance and uniform trajectory spacing. The fermat looped, orthogonally encoded trajectories (FLORET) design produces less gradient-efficient trajectories near the poles, so multiple orthogonal hub designs are shown. These multihub designs oversample k-space twice with orthogonal trajectories, which gives unique properties but also doubles the minimum scan time for critical sampling of k-space. The trajectory is shown to be much more efficient than the conventional stack of cones trajectory, and has nearly the same signal-to-noise ratio efficiency (but twice the minimum scan time) as a stack of spirals trajectory. As a center-out trajectory, it provides a shorter minimum echo time than stack of spirals, and its spherical k-space coverage can dramatically reduce Gibbs ringing.},

	Abstract = {Atherosclerosis is a complex disease whose spatial distribution is hypothesized to be influenced by the local hemodynamic environment. The use of transgenic mice provides a mechanism to study the relationship between hemodynamic forces, most notably wall shear stress (WSS), and the molecular factors that influence the disease process. Phase contrast MRI using rectilinear trajectories has been used to measure boundary conditions for use in computational fluid dynamic models. However, the unique flow environment of the mouse precludes use of standard imaging techniques in complex, curved flow regions such as the aortic arch. In this article, two-dimensional and three-dimensional spiral cine phase contrast sequences are presented that enable measurement of velocity profiles in curved regions of the mouse vasculature. WSS is calculated directly from the spatial velocity gradient, enabling WSS calculation with a minimal set of assumptions. In contrast to the outer radius of the aortic arch, the inner radius has a lower time-averaged longitudinal WSS (7.06 $\pm$ 0.76 dyne/cm(2) vs. 18.86 $\pm$ 1.27 dyne/cm(2) ; P < 0.01) and higher oscillatory shear index (0.14 $\pm$ 0.01 vs. 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01; P < 0.01). This finding is in agreement with humans, where WSS is lower and more oscillatory along the inner radius, an atheroprone region, than the outer radius, an atheroprotective region.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of radial phase contrast MR imaging to measure in vivo pulse wave velocity (PWV) and wall shear stress (WSS) in small animals on a 7 Tesla scanner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aortic compliance of 9-month-old ApoE deficient (ApoE-KO) mice (n = 10) on a normal diet was studied in comparison to that of wild-type (WT) mice (n = 10). An undersampled, asymmetric echo radial phase contrast MR technique was developed to measure through plane blood flow velocity at axial slices along the descending aorta. The PWV and the time averaged WSS was calculated from the spatiotemporal flow data. The reproducibility of PWV and WSS was evaluated by taking multiple measures on a separate cohort of WT (n = 4) mice.
RESULTS: The mean percentage standard deviation among repeated measures was 10.1% for PWV and 24.8% for WSS. The PWV of ApoE-KO mice (5.84 +/- 2.15 m/s) was significantly higher (p = 0.02) than that of WT (3.55 +/- 0.97 m/s), whereas WSS was lower in ApoE-KO mice (1.44 +/- 0.31Pa) compared with WT (1.55 +/- 0.36Pa).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that in vivo PWV derived from radial phase contrast MR imaging can be potentially used as a surrogate marker for impaired vascular function in mice.},

This representation of the coronary lumen is not directly analogous to the information provided by x-ray coronary angiography, in which the coronary lumen displayed by iodinated contrast agent is seen. Analogous "luminographic" data may be obtained using MR arterial spin tagging (projection coronary MRA) techniques. Such an approach was implemented using a 2D selective "pencil" excitation for aortic spin tagging in concert with a 3D interleaved segmented spiral imaging sequence with free-breathing, and real-time navigator technology. This technique allows for selective 3D visualization of the coronary lumen blood-pool, while signal from the surrounding structures is suppressed.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance global coherent free precession (GCFP) is a new technique that produces cine projection angiograms directly analogous to those of x-ray angiography noninvasively and without a contrast agent. In this study, we compared GCFP blood flow with "gold standards" to determine the accuracy of noninvasive GCFP blood flow measurements.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The relationship between GCFP blood flow and true blood flow defined by invasive ultrasonic flow probe and by phase contrast velocity encoded MRI (VENC) was studied in anesthetized dogs (n=6). Blood flow was controlled by use of a hydraulic occluder around the left iliac artery. GCFP images were acquired by selectively exciting the abdominal aorta and visualizing temporal blood flow into the iliac arteries. GCFP flow was similar to ultrasonic blood flow at baseline (131.3+/-44.8 versus 114.8+/-34.2 mL/min), during occlusion (10.8+/-5.1 versus 6.5+/-7.2 mL/min), during reactive hyperemia (191.4+/-100.7 versus 260.3+/-138.7 mL/min), during the new resting state (135.5+/-52.4 versus 117.8+/-24.1 mL/min), and during partial occlusion (61.4+/-36.4 versus 49.3+/-13.1 mL/min, P=NS for all). Results comparing GCFP flow with VENC were similar. Statistical analysis revealed that GCFP flow was related to mean blood flow assessed by the flow probe (P<0.0001) and by VENC (P<0.0001). In the control right iliac artery, conversely, GCFP measurements were unaffected throughout all left iliac interventions (P=NS).
CONCLUSIONS: GCFP blood flow is linearly related to true blood flow for a straight, cylindrical blood vessel without branches. Although more complex geometries imply a qualitative rather than a quantitative relationship, the data nevertheless suggest that GCFP may serve as the basis for a new form of noninvasive stress testing.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate the feasibility of coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in living mice and to evaluate a dynamic MR angiographic method for coronary flow measurement at 9.4-T field strength.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted according to European law and was in full compliance with National Institutes of Health recommendations for animal care and a local institutional animal care committee. Mice were anesthetized by using isoflurane. First, time-of-flight MR angiography was performed in 10 mice to measure coronary diameters at 80-mum isotropic resolution. Second, left coronary artery (LCA) velocity measurements were performed at seven cardiac phases in nine other mice to assess the velocity curve profile. Third, coronary velocities were measured at the middiastolic phase in 13 mice at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia to calculate coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR). The Pearson coefficient compared the correlation between isoflurane dose and CFVR. Paired t tests compared R-R intervals and respiratory rates between rest and hyperemia.
RESULTS: Proximal diameters were, respectively, 404 mum +/- 34 [standard deviation] and 259 mum +/- 22 for the LCAs and the right coronary arteries, which were in accordance with reported values. The velocity curve profile throughout the cardiac cycle was similar to values from the literature. Baseline and hyperemic velocities were, respectively, 19.0 cm/sec +/- 4.4 and 33.7 cm/sec +/- 4.7 (P<.001), resulting in a CFVR of 1.77 +/- 0.19. CFVR did not correlate with isoflurane dose (r = 0.05, P = .88). R-R intervals shortened by 2.5% during hyperemia (P = .04). Respiratory rates showed no difference between rest and hyperemia (P = .39).
CONCLUSION: High-spatial-resolution three-dimensional coronary MR angiography is feasible in living mice. Dynamic MR angiography depicts coronary velocity changes throughout the cardiac cycle and between rest and maximum hyperemia, providing a tool for CFVR assessment.},

@article{Markl:2012pi,
	Abstract = {Traditionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of flow using phase contrast (PC) methods is accomplished using methods that resolve single-directional flow in two spatial dimensions (2D) of an individual slice. More recently, three-dimensional (3D) spatial encoding combined with three-directional velocity-encoded phase contrast MRI (here termed 4D flow MRI) has drawn increased attention. 4D flow MRI offers the ability to measure and to visualize the temporal evolution of complex blood flow patterns within an acquired 3D volume. Various methodological improvements permit the acquisition of 4D flow MRI data encompassing individual vascular structures and entire vascular territories such as the heart, the adjacent aorta, the carotid arteries, abdominal, or peripheral vessels within reasonable scan times. To subsequently analyze the flow data by quantitative means and visualization of complex, three-directional blood flow patterns, various tools have been proposed. This review intends to introduce currently used 4D flow MRI methods, including Cartesian and radial data acquisition, approaches for accelerated data acquisition, cardiac gating, and respiration control. Based on these developments, an overview is provided over the potential this new imaging technique has in different parts of the body from the head to the peripheral arteries.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To present an unenhanced four-dimensional time-resolved dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) angiography technique with true fast imaging with steady-state precession-based spin tagging with alternating radiofrequency (STAR), also called TrueSTAR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study received Institutional Review Board approval and was HIPAA compliant. Informed consent was obtained from all study subjects. In eight healthy volunteers, the spatial and temporal resolution of the TrueSTAR technique were optimized. In another six healthy volunteers, the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the TrueSTAR dynamic MR angiography images were compared with those acquired by using a standard Look-Locker echo-planar technique by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Finally, one patient with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was studied by using this technique.
RESULTS: The SNR and CNR of the TrueSTAR dynamic MR angiography images were 29% and 39% higher, respectively, compared with those acquired by using a standard Look-Locker echo-planar imaging sequence (both P = .028). In the AVM patient, TrueSTAR dynamic MR angiography delineated the dynamic course of labeled blood flowing through feeding arteries into the nidus and draining veins.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that TrueSTAR is a promising unenhanced dynamic MR angiography technique for clinical evaluation of cerebrovascular disorders such as AVM, steno-occlusive disease, and aneurysm.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tools are required for the longitudinal investigation of vascular diseases in mouse models. Angiographic data from various anatomic regions may be needed in a single experiment. This study involves a three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) method using sequential acquisitions of four data sets corresponding to the head, the thorax, the abdomen, and the hind limbs of a mouse. After repositioning the animal, each anatomic region was acquired in 2 min, and the TOF effect was provided by the spatial selectivity of the radio frequency (RF) resonator. No slab selection was needed and whole-body MRA was performed in a total experiment time of 10 min. The voxel size was equal to or greater than 131 × 195 × 188 μm(3). To suppress the signal arising from stationary tissues, both inversion recovery and interspersed saturation, used as magnetization preparations, were compared from a theoretical and an experimental perspective. The arterial tree (carotid, aortic, iliac, renal, and smaller arteries) was well visualized by this method, both in control healthy mice and in mice with common carotid artery ligation. The potential interest of this method for evaluating arterial diseases is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Blood flow velocity is a functional parameter of fundamental importance in diagnosis and follow-up of various vascular diseases. Vascular pathologies can be efficiently studied in animal models, especially in small rodents. ECG-gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of blood velocity in small animals is a challenge because of limited spatial resolution and high-frequency physiological parameters. Here it is shown that a bright-blood cine-3D-MRI method can be used to measure blood velocity at specific times of the cardiac cycle in mouse pulmonary and carotid arteries. The method used a series of time-of-flight (TOF) acquisitions in a volume of interest at different times after signal cancellation in the same volume. This scheme was repeated at different periods of the cardiac cycle by varying the delay between the ECG R-wave peak and signal cancellation. Velocity values in mouse pulmonary artery varied from 35 cm/s in systole to 0-10 cm/s in diastole. A similar pattern was displayed in carotid arteries (18 and 2.5 cm/s, in systole and diastole, respectively). Results are discussed in terms of efficiency, limitation, and comparison with other methods.},

	Abstract = {Blood velocity is a functional parameter that is not easily assessed noninvasively, especially in small animals. A new noninvasive method that uses magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to measure blood flows is proposed. This method is based on the time-of-flight (TOF) phenomenon. By initially suppressing the signal from the stationary spins in the area of interest, it is possible to sequentially visualize only the signal from the moving spins entering a given volume. With this method, 3D cine images of the blood flow can be generated by positive contrast, with unparalleled spatial (<200 microm) and temporal resolutions (<10 ms/image). As a result, it is possible to measure flow in sinuous paths. The present method was applied in vivo to measure the blood velocity in mouse carotid arteries. Because of its robustness and simplicity of implementation, this method has numerous potential applications for fundamental studies in small animal models.},

Recently it has been shown that undersampled projection reconstruction can acquire higher resolution per unit time than Fourier techniques with acceptable artifacts when used in contrast-enhanced MR angiography. Undersampled projection reconstruction has similar potential for phase-contrast acquisitions. Flow sensitization gradients are used with projection trajectories to acquire velocity-dependent phase information. An acquisition scheme that acquires three flow encoding directions on three sets of angular-interleaved projections is introduced. Depending on the resolution, acquisition times for 3D datasets can decrease by factors of two to four.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: In this work, we investigate the spatial and temporal fidelity of highly constrained backPRojection (HYPR) processing using a computer-controlled motion phantom. The goal of this experimental set-up was to provide not only well-defined temporal dynamics and spatial characteristics of the motion phantom, but also circumstances that imitate in vivo scenarios. METHODS: The phantom was designed to represent an artery flanked on both sides by vein. Both arterial and venous components have different temporal dynamics but are confluent, which corresponds to a difficult scenario for HYPR. Spatial and temporal fidelity was investigated by measuring signal intensity profiles through the phantom both orthogonal to as well as along the direction of motion. RESULTS: Spatial fidelity profiles measured from the HYPR processed images yielded full-width-at-half-maximum values very similar to those measured in non-HYPR-processed images. Furthermore, there was no significant spreading of the motion phantom leading edge in HYPR processed images. CONCLUSION: Although HYPR processing has certain characteristic artifacts that are discussed, the technique can be used to improve image quality of highly undersampled time frame images with minimal loss of spatial or temporal fidelity.

	Abstract = {Sufficient temporal resolution is required to image the dynamics of blood flow, which may be critical for accurate diagnosis and treatment of various intracranial vascular diseases, such as arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and aneurysms. Highly-constrained projection reconstruction (HYPR) has recently become a technique of interest for high-speed contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA). HYPR provides high frame rates by preferential weighting of radial projections while maintaining signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using a high SNR composite. An analysis was done to quantify the effects of HYPR on SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and temporal blur compared to the previously developed radial sliding-window technique using standard filtered backprojection or regridding methods. Computer simulations were performed to study the effects of HYPR processing on image error and the temporal information. Additionally, in vivo imaging was done on patients with angiographically confirmed AVMs to measure the effects of alteration of various HYPR parameters on SNR as well as the fidelity of the temporal information. The images were scored by an interventional radiologist in a blinded read and were compared with X-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA). It was found that with the right choice of parameters, modest improvements in both SNR and dynamic information can be achieved as compared to radial sliding-window MRA.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the relationships among highly constrained back projection (HYPR)-LR, projection reconstruction focal underdetermined system solver (PR-FOCUSS), and k-t FOCUSS by showing how each method relates to a generalized reference image reconstruction method. That is, the generalized series model employs a fixed reference image and multiplicative corrections-that model is extended here to consider reference images more broadly, both in image space and in transform spaces (x-t and x-f spaces), and that can evolve with iteration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Theoretical relationships between the methods were derived. Computer simulations were done to compare HYPR-LR to one iteration of PR-FOCUSS. The generalized reference approaches applied in the x-t or x-f domain were compared using computer simulation, five cardiac cine imaging datasets, and six myocardial perfusion datasets.
RESULTS: PR-FOCUSS and HYPR-LR gave comparable errors, with PR-FOCUSS slightly outperforming HYPR-LR. The baseline image is important to the performance of k-t FOCUSS and x-t FOCUSS, as demonstrated by results from cardiac cine imaging. For cardiac perfusion reconstructions with the use of a temporal average image as the baseline image, k-t FOCUSS gave lower errors than x-t FOCUSS.
CONCLUSION: HYPR-LR and PR-FOCUSS are closely related: both work for radial sampling and use reference images in the x-t domain; HYPR-LR is an approximate implementation of the generalized reference framework, while PR-FOCUSS is a conjugate gradient implementation of the generalized reference framework. The superiority of generalized reference approaches applied in the x-t or x-f domain was sensitive to the characteristics of the acquired data and to the baseline image used.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To improve spatial and temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in three-dimensional (3D) radial contrast-enhanced (CE) time-resolved MR angiography by means of a novel hybrid phase contrast (PC) and CE MRA acquisition and HYPR reconstruction (PC HYPR Flow).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC HYPR Flow consists of a CE exam immediately followed by a PC scan used to constrain the HYPR reconstruction of the time series. Temporal resolution of the new method was studied in computer simulations. The feasibility of the new technique was studied in healthy subjects and patients with brain arteriovenous malformations and in a canine model of aneurysms.
RESULTS: Simulations demonstrated preservation of contrast agent dynamics in proximal vessels, showing better performance than peer methods for acceleration up to 20 in 2D. In vivo, PC HYPR Flow yielded 3D time series with frame rate of 0.5 s and significantly outperformed two peer methods by means of a major increase in spatial resolution (0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 mm(3)) and arterial/venous ratio, while maintaining necessary temporal waveform fidelity and high SNR.
CONCLUSION: This initial study indicates that PC HYPR Flow simultaneously provides 3D isotropic sub-millimeter spatial resolution, sub-second temporal reconstruction windows and high SNR level, which may benefit a wide range of CE MRA applications.},

	Abstract = {A method for reconstruction of time-resolved MRI called highly-constrained backprojection (HYPR) has been developed. To evaluate the HYPR reconstruction in relation to data sparsity and temporal dynamics, computer simulations were performed, investigating signal modulations under different situations that reflect dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography (MRA). In vivo studies were also performed with gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) for abdominal MRA in a canine model to demonstrate the application of HYPR for three-dimensional (3D) time-resolved MRA. When contrast dynamics vary over space, large vessels (e.g., veins) tend to introduce signal interference to small vessels (e.g., arteries) in HYPR, particularly when the vessels are in close proximity. The enhancement of background tissue signals may also alter the arterial and venous temporal profiles in HYPR. However, the artifacts are manifest as intensity modulation rather than structural interference, and therefore have little impact on structural diagnosis. Increasing the number of projections per time point increases temporal blur while reducing corruption of temporal behavior from adjacent tissues. Uniformly interleaved acquisition order, such as the bit-reversed order, is important to reduce artifacts. With high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and limited artifacts, HYPR reconstruction has potential to greatly improve time-resolved MRA in clinical practice.},

	Abstract = {Recently, the highly-constrained backprojection (HYPR) and HYPR with local reconstruction (HYPR LR) methods have been introduced to reconstruct magnitude images from a series of highly undersampled data while preserving high spatial and temporal resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in applications with spatiotemporal correlations. However, these conventional HYPR algorithms are limited to the generation of magnitude images and, therefore, have limitations in their potential applications. In this work, the HYPR LR algorithm has been modified to extend the use of algorithms in the HYPR family to applications that require processing of complex data, such as MR chemical shift imaging (CSI) or spectroscopic imaging. The proposed method processes the magnitude information the same way as in original HYPR LR processing. In addition, it improves the phase images by subtracting the phase map of a synthesized composite image. The feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm has been demonstrated on CSI of cortical bone, Achilles tendon, and a healthy volunteer on a clinical 3T scanner.},

	Abstract = {The highly constrained backprojection algorithm (HYPR) has recently been shown to allow accelerated acquisition in various fields of MRI, including angiography, perfusion and diffusion imaging as well as hyperpolarized gas imaging. Increase in temporal resolution is of particular interest in the case of small animal ventilation imaging due to the high respiration rate. In the present study, the two-dimensional HYPR technique and its iterative version (I-HYPR) were applied to (3)He ventilation imaging in rats. Two imaging protocols were used for two separate groups of animals. A single inspiration protocol consisted of (3)He imaging of the lungs during gas inflow and a following apnea. A multiple inspiration protocol involved spontaneous breathing of (3)He contained in a gas reservoir. Series of HYPR frames with four-fold increase in the temporal resolution were obtained in the case of the single inspiration experiment. For the multiple inspiration protocol, series of HYPR images corresponding to four different echo times were obtained and were used to reconstruct T(2)(*) maps at the inspiration and the expiration phases of the breathing cycle. The feasibility of using the two-dimensional HYPR technique for different (3)He ventilation protocols in small animals is demonstrated. Image quality and signal kinetics representations are compared for two variants of the HYPR algorithm.},

	Abstract = {An undersampled diffusion-weighted stack-of-stars acquisition is combined with iterative highly constrained back-projection to perform hyperpolarized helium-3 MR q-space imaging with combined regional correction of radiofrequency- and T1-related signal loss in a single breath-held scan. The technique is tested in computer simulations and phantom experiments and demonstrated in a healthy human volunteer with whole-lung coverage in a 13-sec breath-hold. Measures of lung microstructure at three different lung volumes are evaluated using inhaled gas volumes of 500 mL, 1000 mL, and 1500 mL to demonstrate feasibility. Phantom results demonstrate that the proposed technique is in agreement with theoretical values, as well as with a fully sampled two-dimensional Cartesian acquisition. Results from the volunteer study demonstrate that the root mean squared diffusion distance increased significantly from the 500-mL volume to the 1000-mL volume. This technique represents the first demonstration of a spatially resolved hyperpolarized helium-3 q-space imaging technique and shows promise for microstructural evaluation of lung disease in three dimensions.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the properties of HYPR (HighlY constrained back PRojection) processing-the temporal fidelity and the improvements of spatial/temporal resolution-for contrast-enhanced MR angiography in a pilot study of the lower extremities in healthy volunteers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HYPR processing with a radial three-dimensional (3D) stack-of-stars acquisition was investigated for contrast-enhanced MR angiography of the lower extremities in 15 healthy volunteers. HYPR images were compared with control images acquired using a fast, multiphase, 2D Cartesian method to verify the temporal fidelity of HYPR. HYPR protocols were developed for achieving either a high frame update rate or a minimal slice thickness by adjusting the acquisition parameters. HYPR images were compared with images obtained using 3D TRICKS, a widely used protocol in dynamic 3D MRA.
RESULTS: HYPR images showed good temporal agreement with 2D control images. In comparison with TRICKS, HYPR stack-of-stars demonstrated higher spatial and temporal resolution. High radial undersampling factors for each time frame were permitted, typically approximately 50 to 100 compared with fully sampled radial imaging.
CONCLUSION: In this feasibility study, HYPR processing has been demonstrated to improve the spatial or temporal resolution in peripheral CE-MRA.},

@article{Mistretta:2009dq,
	Abstract = {During the past several years there has been extensive study of alternative MR acquisition strategies such as spiral and radial. Vastly undersampled imaging with projections (VIPR) is a three-dimensional (3D) radial acquisition that provides acceptable images while violating the Nyquist theorem by factors of up to several hundred. For applications like magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), VIPR provides sparse data sets with incoherent artifacts that satisfy the requirements of emerging reconstruction approaches like iterative image norm minimization (compressed sensing) and highly constrained back projection (HYPR). All of these tools can be used in combination with parallel imaging to provide extremely high acceleration factors in MRI. In this review we do not attempt to do justice to the many exciting developments in the general field of constrained reconstruction but focus on preliminary results using VIPR and HYPR for non-Cartesian, Nyquist-violating MRI and the extension of HYPR processing to a broad range of medical imaging applications in which the acquisitions satisfy the Nyquist theorem but lack sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to the possibility of radiation reduction, increased ultrasound resolution and field-of-view, and improved dynamic display of radiotracers.},

	Abstract = {Recent work in k-t BLAST and undersampled projection angiography has emphasized the value of using training data sets obtained during the acquisition of a series of images. These techniques have used iterative algorithms guided by the training set information to reconstruct time frames sampled at well below the Nyquist limit. We present here a simple non-iterative unfiltered backprojection algorithm that incorporates the idea of a composite image consisting of portions or all of the acquired data to constrain the backprojection process. This significantly reduces streak artifacts and increases the overall SNR, permitting decreased numbers of projections to be used when acquiring each image in the image time series. For undersampled 2D projection imaging applications, such as cine phase contrast (PC) angiography, our results suggest that the angular undersampling factor, relative to Nyquist requirements, can be increased from the present factor of 4 to about 100 while increasing SNR per individual time frame. Results are presented for a contrast-enhanced PR HYPR TRICKS acquisition in a volunteer using an angular undersampling factor of 75 and a TRICKS temporal undersampling factor of 3 for an overall undersampling factor of 225.},

	Abstract = {Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a promising technique for coronary artery imaging. The blood signal changes during the contrast injection will result in image artifacts, blurring and relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, when the k-space segments from different cardiac cycles are combined to reconstruct the final image as "time averaged." Thus, it is important to acquire data during maximal blood signal enhancement for first-pass, contrast-enhanced MRA, and relatively high temporal resolution is required. This work demonstrated the feasibility of highly constrained backprojection reconstruction for time-resolved, contrast-enhanced coronary MRA. With this method, the temporal resolution can be increased. In addition, coronary artery images around blood signal enhancement peak have significantly improved contrast-to-noise ratio and suppressed artifacts compared to the composite images which were collected during a much longer acquisition time during substantial blood signal changes.},

	Abstract = {Time-resolved contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography of the brain is challenging due to the need for rapid imaging and high spatial resolution. Moreover, the significant dispersion of the intravenous contrast bolus as it passes through the heart and lungs increases the overlap between arterial and venous structures, regardless of the acquisition speed and reconstruction window. An innovative technique is presented that divides a single dose contrast into two injections. Initially a small volume of contrast material (2-3 mL) is used to acquiring time-resolved weighting images with a high frame rate (2 frames/s) during the first pass of the contrast agent. The remaining contrast material is used to obtain a high resolution whole brain contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography (0.57 × 0.57 × 1 mm(3) ) that is used as the spatial constraint for Local Highly Constrained Projection Reconstruction (HYPR LR) reconstruction. After HYPR reconstruction, the final dynamic images (HYPR CE) have both high temporal and spatial resolution. Furthermore, studies of contrast kinetics demonstrate that the shorter bolus length from the reduced contrast volume used for the first injection significantly improves the arterial and venous separation.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate a method to enable single-slice or multiple-slice cine phase contrast (cine-PC) acquisition during a single breath-hold using a highly sparsified radial acquisition ordering and temporally constrained image reconstruction with a spatially varying temporal constraint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Simulated and in vivo cine-PC datasets of the proximal ascending aorta were obtained at different acceleration factors using a view projection acquisition order optimized for temporally constrained reconstruction (TCR). Reconstruction of the sparse cine-PC data performed with TCR was compared to reconstructions using zero-filled regridding and temporal interpolation. RESULTS: TCR resulted in more accurate velocity measurements than regridding or temporal interpolation. In one dataset, TCR of undersampled in vivo data (16 views per cardiac phase) resulted in a peak systolic velocity within 3.3% of the value measured by Doppler ultrasound while shortening the scan time to 13 seconds. High temporal-resolution undersampled TCR was also compared lower temporal-resolution, more highly sampled, regridding in three normal volunteers. CONCLUSION: TCR proved to be an effective method for reconstructing undersampled radial PC data. Although TCR utilizes a temporal constraint, temporal blurring was minimized by using appropriate constraint weights in addition to a spatially varying temporal constraint. TCR allowed for the acquisition time to be reduced to the duration of a breath-hold, while still resulting in accurate velocity measurements.J. Magn. Reson.

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of using time-of-flight (TOF) images as a constraint in the reconstruction of a series of highly undersampled time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR images (HYPR TOF), to allow simultaneously high temporal and spatial resolution and increased SNR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers and three patients with aneurysms underwent a HYPR TOF study, which includes a clinical routine TOF scan followed by a first pass time-resolved contrast-enhanced exam using an undersampled three-dimensional (3D) projection trajectory (VIPR). Image quality, waveform fidelity and signal to background variation ratio measurements were compared between HYPR TOF images and VIPR images without HYPR reconstruction.
RESULTS: Volunteer results demonstrated the feasibility of using the clinical routine TOF as the spatial constraint to reconstruct the first pass time-resolved contrast-enhanced MRA acquired using highly undersampled 3D projection trajectory (VIPR). All the HYPR TOF images are superior to the corresponding VIPR images with the same temporal reconstruction window on both spatial resolution and SNR.
CONCLUSION: HYPR TOF improves the spatial resolution and SNR of the rapidly acquired dynamic images without losing the temporal information.},

	Abstract = {As the complexity of the magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) techniques grows, it becomes more difficult for the practicing radiologist to appreciate the physical principles underlying these studies. Nevertheless, such an understanding is requisite for improving clinical image quality. As radiologists are most accustomed to dealing with medical images in everyday practice, it seems natural that an image-based approach to teaching MRA physics, rather than complex mathematical equations or pulse sequence diagrams, would be preferable. This article adopts such an approach. Simple ways to improve MRA image quality are emphasized along with new technologies and their physical basis. The ultimate goal of the article is to facilitate the practicing radiologist becoming more aware of the variety of MR techniques available, being more confident in modifying sequence parameters to improve image quality and reduce contrast dose, and understanding the basis behind newer MRA techniques.},

@article{Grist:2012fk,
	Abstract = {The introduction of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in 1980 provided a method for real time 2D subtraction imaging. Later, 4D magnetic resonance (MR) angiography emerged beginning with techniques like Keyhole and time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (TRICKS) that provided frame rates of one every 5 seconds with limited spatial resolution. Undersampled radial acquisition was subsequently developed. The 3D vastly undersampled isotropic projection (VIPR) technique allowed undersampling factors of 30-40. Its combination with phase contrast displays time-resolved flow dynamics within the cardiac cycle and has enabled the measurement of pressure gradients in small vessels. Meanwhile similar accelerations were achieved using Cartesian acquisition with projection reconstruction (CAPR), a Cartesian acquisition with 2D parallel imaging. Further acceleration is provided by constrained reconstruction techniques such as highly constrained back-projection reconstruction (HYPR) and its derivatives, which permit acceleration factors approaching 1000. Hybrid MRA combines a separate phase contrast, time-of flight, or contrast-enhanced acquisition to constrain the reconstruction of contrast-enhanced time frames providing exceptional spatial and temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This can be extended to x-ray imaging where a 3D DSA examination can be used to constrain the reconstruction of time-resolved 3D volumes. Each 4D DSA (time-resolved 3D DSA) frame provides spatial resolution and SNR comparable to 3D DSA, thus removing a major limitation of intravenous DSA. Similar techniques have provided the ability to do 4D fluoroscopy.},

	Abstract = {The recently introduced HYPR (HighlY constrained backPRojection) method allows reconstruction of serial images from highly undersampled data. In HYPR, individual timeframes are obtained via unfiltered backprojections of normalized sinograms using anatomical constraints provided by a composite image. Here we develop the idea of constraining the backprojected data further to a series of local regions of interest in order to decrease the corruption of local information by distant signals. HYPR LR (local reconstruction) permits the use of a longer temporal window in the formation of the composite image, resulting in increased signal-to-noise ratio and quantitative reconstruction accuracy. Unlike HYPR, the new HYPR LR method can be applied to images acquired with arbitrary k-space trajectories. It is suitable for a broad range of medical imaging applications involving serial changes in image sequence, offering exciting new opportunities in the future.},

	Abstract = {The projection reconstruction (PR) trajectory was investigated for the effect of gradient timing delays between the actual and requested start time of each physical gradient. Radial trajectories constructed with delayed gradients miss the center of k-space in an angularly dependent manner, causing effective echo times to vary with projection angle. The gradient timing delays were measured in phantoms, revealing delays on the x, y, and z gradients which differed by as much as 5 micro sec. Using this one-time calibration measurement, the trajectories were corrected for gradient delays by addition of compensatory gradient areas to the prephasers of the logical x and y readout gradients. Effective projection-to-projection echo time variability was reduced to less than 1 micro sec for all imaging orientations. Using corrected trajectories, artifacts were reduced in phantom images and in volunteer studies. This correction should potentiate greater clinical use of the PR trajectory.},

	Abstract = {One of the current limitations of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography is the requirement of both high spatial and high temporal resolution. Several undersampling techniques have been proposed to overcome this problem. However, in most of these methods the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution is constant for all the time frames and needs to be specified prior to data collection. This is not optimal for dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography where the dynamics of the process are difficult to predict and the image quality requirements are changing during the bolus passage. Here, we propose a new highly undersampled approach that allows the retrospective adaptation of the spatial and temporal resolution. The method combines a three-dimensional radial phase encoding trajectory with the golden angle profile order and non-Cartesian Sensitivity Encoding (SENSE) reconstruction. Different regularization images, obtained from the same acquired data, are used to stabilize the non-Cartesian SENSE reconstruction for the different phases of the bolus passage. The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated on a numerical phantom and in three-dimensional intracranial dynamic contrast-enhanced MR angiography of healthy volunteers. The acquired data were reconstructed retrospectively with temporal resolutions from 1.2 sec to 8.1 sec, providing a good depiction of small vessels, as well as distinction of different temporal phases.},

	Abstract = {A disadvantage of three-dimensional (3D) isotropic acquisition in whole-heart coronary MRI is the prolonged data acquisition time. Isotropic 3D radial trajectories allow undersampling of k-space data in all three spatial dimensions, enabling accelerated acquisition of the volumetric data. Compressed sensing (CS) reconstruction can provide further acceleration in the acquisition by removing the incoherent artifacts due to undersampling and improving the image quality. However, the heavy computational overhead of the CS reconstruction has been a limiting factor for its application. In this article, a parallelized implementation of an iterative CS reconstruction method for 3D radial acquisitions using a commercial graphics processing unit is presented. The execution time of the graphics processing unit-implemented CS reconstruction was compared with that of the C++ implementation, and the efficacy of the undersampled 3D radial acquisition with CS reconstruction was investigated in both phantom and whole-heart coronary data sets. Subsequently, the efficacy of CS in suppressing streaking artifacts in 3D whole-heart coronary MRI with 3D radial imaging and its convergence properties were studied. The CS reconstruction provides improved image quality (in terms of vessel sharpness and suppression of noise-like artifacts) compared with the conventional 3D gridding algorithm, and the graphics processing unit implementation greatly reduces the execution time of CS reconstruction yielding 34-54 times speed-up compared with C++ implementation.},

	Abstract = {A respiratory navigator with a fixed acceptance gating window is commonly used to reduce respiratory motion artifacts in cardiac MR. This approach prolongs the scan time and occasionally yields an incomplete dataset due to respiratory drifts. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive gating window approach in which the size and position of the gating window are changed adaptively during the acquisition based on the individual's breathing pattern. The adaptive gating window tracks the breathing pattern of the subject throughout the scan and adapts the size and position of the gating window such that the gating efficiency is always fixed at a constant value. To investigate the image quality and acquisition time, free breathing cardiac MRI, including both targeted coronary MRI and late gadolinium enhancement imaging, was performed in 67 subjects using the proposed navigator technique. Targeted coronary MRI was acquired from eleven healthy adult subjects using both the conventional and proposed adaptive gating window techniques. Fifty-six patients referred for cardiac MRI were also imaged using late gadolinium enhancement with the proposed adaptive gating window technique. Subjective and objective image assessments were used to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed technique allows free-breathing cardiac MRI in a relatively fixed time without compromising imaging quality due to respiratory motion artifacts.},

	Abstract = {A method for motion correction in multicoil imaging applications, involving both data collection and reconstruction, is presented. A bit-reversed radial acquisition scheme, in conjunction with a rapid self-calibrated parallel imaging method, Generalized auto-calibrating partial parallel acquisition (GRAPPA) operator for wider radial bands (GROWL), is used to achieve motion correction at a high temporal resolution. View-by-view in-plane motion correction is achieved in 2D imaging, while 3D motion correction is achieved for every two consecutive slice-encoding planes in 3D imaging. In the proposed technique, GROWL contributes in two aspects: First, a central k-space circle/cylinder used as the motion-free reference is generated from a small number of radial lines/planes; Second, undersampled k-space regions resulting from rotation and inconsistent (e.g. intraview and nonrigid body) motion can be filled in. When compared with navigator-based motion correction methods, the proposed method does not prolong scan time and can be applied to short-TR sequences.

	Abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) twisted projection imaging (TPI) trajectory has a unique advantage in sodium ((23)Na) imaging on clinical MRI scanners at 1.5 or 3 T, generating a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a short acquisition time (approximately 10 min). Parallel imaging with an array of coil elements transits SNR benefits from small coil elements to acquisition efficiency by sampling partial k-space. This study investigates the feasibility of parallel sodium imaging with emphases on SNR and acceleration benefits provided by the 3D TPI trajectory. Computer simulations were used to find available acceleration factors and noise amplification. Human head studies were performed on clinical 1.5/3-T scanners with four-element coil arrays to verify simulation outcomes. In in vivo studies, proton ((1)H) data, however, were acquired for concept-proof purpose. The sensitivity encoding (SENSE) method with the conjugate gradient algorithm was used to reconstruct images from accelerated TPI-SENSE data sets. Self-calibration was employed to estimate coil sensitivities. Noise amplification in TPI-SENSE was evaluated using multiple noise trials. It was found that the acceleration factor was as high as 5.53 (corresponding to acceleration number 2 x 3, ring-by-rotation), with a small image error of 6.9% when TPI projections were reduced in both polar (ring) and azimuthal (rotation) directions. The average noise amplification was as low as 98.7%, or 27% lower than Cartesian SENSE at that acceleration factor. The 3D nature of both TPI trajectory and coil sensitivities might be responsible for the high acceleration and low noise amplification. Consequently, TPI-SENSE may have potential advantages for parallel sodium imaging.},

	Abstract = {In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), methods that use a non-Cartesian grid in k-space are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we use a recently proposed implicit discretisation scheme which generalises the standard approach based on gridding. While the latter succeeds for sufficiently uniform sampling sets and accurate estimated density compensation weights, the implicit method further improves the reconstruction quality when the sampling scheme or the weights are less regular. Both approaches can be solved efficiently with the nonequispaced FFT. Due to several new techniques for the storage of an involved sparse matrix, our examples include also the reconstruction of a large 3D data set. We present four case studies and report on efficient implementation of the related algorithms.},

	Abstract = {A new way to correct magnetic resonance image artifacts resulting from view-dependent phase variations and view-dependent variations in rigid body object translation is presented by exploiting basic properties of the trajectory of radial k-space acquisitions. Simulations, phantom studies, and in vivo experiments are used to demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of this method. While somewhat analogous to navigator echo correction, in which special gradients are interleaved into the imaging sequence so echoes at the center of k-space can be acquired prior to or after collection of the image data, the current method does not require additional new gradient structures within the pulse sequence or increases in scan time. The new method uses the phase information from all collected radial k-space data points rather than only the navigator echo, which permits correction of multiple sources of view-dependent phase variation in the image data. The resultant effect is improved image quality in radial MRI acquisitions. Magn Reson Med 45:277-288, 2001.},

	Abstract = {Radial imaging techniques, such as projection-reconstruction (PR), are used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for dynamic imaging, angiography, and short-T(2) imaging. They are robust to flow and motion, have diffuse aliasing patterns, and support short readouts and echo times. One drawback is that standard implementations do not support anisotropic field-of-view (FOV) shapes, which are used to match the imaging parameters to the object or region-of-interest. A set of fast, simple algorithms for 2-D and 3-D PR, and 3-D cones acquisitions are introduced that match the sampling density in frequency space to the desired FOV shape. Tailoring the acquisitions allows for reduction of aliasing artifacts in undersampled applications or scan time reductions without introducing aliasing in fully-sampled applications. It also makes possible new radial imaging applications that were previously unsuitable, such as imaging elongated regions or thin slabs. 2-D PR longitudinal leg images and thin-slab, single breath-hold 3-D PR abdomen images, both with isotropic resolution, demonstrate these new possibilities. No scan time to volume efficiency is lost by using anisotropic FOVs. The acquisition trajectories can be computed on a scan by scan basis.},

PR can provide the high-resolution images required for tagging with very few projections, at the expense of artifact. Insight is provided into the PR undersampling artifact, in the context of measuring myocardial motion with tags. For Fourier transform imaging, at least 112 phase-encodings must be collected to image tagging grids spaced 7 pixels apart. PR requires about 80 projections, a 1.4-fold reduction in scan time.

	Abstract = {The undersampled radial acquisition has been widely employed for accelerated (by a factor R = N(r)/N(p)) cardiac imaging, but the resulting reduction in image quality has not been well characterized. This investigation presents a method of measuring these artifacts through synthetic undersampling of high SNR images (SNR > or = 30). After validating the method in phantoms, the method was applied to a study of short-axis, long-axis, and coronary MRI imaging in healthy subjects. For 60 projections (60 N(p)), the total artifact is approximately 10% for short and long-axis imaging (R = 2.1) and approximately 15% for coronary MRI (R = 3.7). For 60 N(p), the SD of artifact in the region of the heart is 2% for short- and long-axis imaging (R = 2.1) and 3.5% for coronary MRI (R = 3.7). The artifact content is less in the region of the heart than in the periphery. The artifact is very reproducible among subjects for standard views. A study of coronary MRI at progressively fewer projections (at constant scan time) showed that right coronary MRI images were acceptable if total artifact was <6.5% of image content (N(p) > 120, R = 2.1).},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: T1 mapping allows direct in-vivo quantitation of microscopic changes in the myocardium, providing new diagnostic insights into cardiac disease. Existing methods require long breath holds that are demanding for many cardiac patients. In this work we propose and validate a novel, clinically applicable, pulse sequence for myocardial T1-mapping that is compatible with typical limits for end-expiration breath-holding in patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Shortened MOdified Look-Locker Inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) method uses sequential inversion recovery measurements within a single short breath-hold. Full recovery of the longitudinal magnetisation between sequential inversion pulses is not achieved, but conditional interpretation of samples for reconstruction of T1-maps is used to yield accurate measurements, and this algorithm is implemented directly on the scanner. We performed computer simulations for 100 ms<T1 < 2.7 s and heart rates 40-100 bpm followed by phantom validation at 1.5T and 3T. In-vivo myocardial T1-mapping using this method and the previous gold-standard (MOLLI) was performed in 10 healthy volunteers at 1.5T and 3T, 4 volunteers with contrast injection at 1.5T, and 4 patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) at 3T.
RESULTS: We found good agreement between the average ShMOLLI and MOLLI estimates for T1 < 1200 ms. In contrast to the original method, ShMOLLI showed no dependence on heart rates for long T1 values, with estimates characterized by a constant 4% underestimation for T1 = 800-2700 ms. In-vivo, ShMOLLI measurements required 9.0 $\pm$ 1.1 s (MOLLI = 17.6 $\pm$ 2.9 s). Average healthy myocardial T1 s by ShMOLLI at 1.5T were 966 $\pm$ 48 ms (mean $\pm$ SD) and 1166 $\pm$ 60 ms at 3T. In MI patients, the T1 in unaffected myocardium (1216 $\pm$ 42 ms) was similar to controls at 3T. Ischemically injured myocardium showed increased T1 = 1432 $\pm$ 33 ms (p < 0.001). The difference between MI and remote myocardium was estimated 15% larger by ShMOLLI than MOLLI (p < 0.04) which suffers from heart rate dependencies for long T1. The in-vivo variability within ShMOLLI T1-maps was only 14% (1.5T) or 18% (3T) higher than the MOLLI maps, but the MOLLI acquisitions were twice longer than ShMOLLI acquisitions.
CONCLUSION: ShMOLLI is an efficient method that generates immediate, high-resolution myocardial T1-maps in a short breath-hold with high precision. This technique provides a valuable clinically applicable tool for myocardial tissue characterisation.},

	Abstract = {Sampling density compensation is an important step in non-cartesian image reconstruction. One of the common techniques to determine weights that compensate for differences in sampling density involves a convolution. A new convolution kernel is designed for sampling density attempting to minimize the error in a fully reconstructed image. The resulting weights obtained using this new kernel are compared with various previous methods, showing a reduction in reconstruction error. A computationally efficient algorithm is also presented that facilitates the calculation of the convolution of finite kernels. Both the kernel and the algorithm are extended to 3D.},

	Abstract = {The reconstruction of non-Cartesian k-space trajectories often requires the estimation of nonuniform sampling density. Particularly for 3D, this calculation can be computationally expensive. The method proposed in this work combines an iterative algorithm previously proposed by Pipe and Menon (Magn Reson Med 1999;41:179-186) with the optimal kernel design previously proposed by Johnson and Pipe (Magn Reson Med 2009;61:439-447). The proposed method shows substantial time reductions in estimating the densities of center-out trajectories, when compared with that of Johnson. It is demonstrated that, depending on the trajectory, the proposed method can provide reductions in execution time by factors of 12 to 85. The method is also shown to be robust in areas of high trajectory overlap, when compared with two analytical density estimation methods, producing a 10-fold increase in accuracy in one case. Initial conditions allow the proposed method to converge in fewer iterations and are shown to be flexible in terms of the accuracy of information supplied. The proposed method is not only one of the fastest and most accurate algorithms, it is also completely generic, allowing any arbitrary trajectory to be density compensated extemporaneously. The proposed method is also simple and can be implemented on parallel computing platforms in a straightforward manner.},

	Abstract = {Imaging of the blood vessels below the knee using contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI is challenging due to the need to coordinate image acquisition and arrival of the contrast in the targeted vessels. Time-resolved acquisitions have been successful in consistently capturing images of the arterial phase of the bolus of contrast agent in the distal extremities. Although time-resolved exams are robust in this respect, higher spatial resolution for the depiction of tight stenoses and the small vessels in the lower leg is desirable. A modification to a high-spatial-resolution T(1)-weighted pulse sequence (projection reconstruction-time resolved imaging of contrast kinetics (PR-TRICKS)) that improves the through-plane spatial resolution by a factor of 2 and maintains a high frame rate is presented. The undersampled PR-TRICKS pulse sequence has been modified to double the spatial resolution in the slice direction by acquiring high-spatial-frequency slice data only after first pass of the bolus of contrast agent. The acquisition reported in the present work (PR-hyperTRICKS) has been used to image healthy volunteers and patients with known vascular disease. The temporal resolution was found to be beneficial in capturing arterial phase images in the presence of asymmetric filling of vessels.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the utility of nonuniform angular spacing of projections in a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid undersampled projection reconstruction (PR) acquisition for contrast-enhanced (CE) time-resolved carotid imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carotid CE magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) was performed on seven healthy volunteers using a time-resolved hybrid sequence that combined undersampled PR acquisition in-plane and Cartesian slice encoding through-plane. The undersampling streak artifact comes mainly from the superior-inferior (S/I) direction in carotid imaging and is suppressed by nonuniform distribution of the projections. Phantom and volunteer studies were performed to demonstrate its efficacy.
RESULTS: The undersampling streak artifact was significantly suppressed through a nonuniform distribution of the projection angles with more projections aligned along the S/I direction. The hybrid PR sequence combined with nonuniform distribution of the projection angles provided time-resolved images of the carotid arteries with high temporal resolution (two seconds per frame) and high spatial resolution (1.0 x 1.0 x 1.5 mm(3)) simultaneously.
CONCLUSION: High-resolution dynamic imaging of the carotid arteries is feasible with the use of a hybrid undersampled PR acquisition. Undersampling streak artifact can be suppressed significantly through nonuniform distribution of the projections.},

	Abstract = {Highly-constrained back-projection (HYPR) is a technique for the reconstruction of sparse, highly-undersampled time-resolved image data. A novel iterative HYPR (I-HYPR) algorithm is presented and validated in computer simulations. The reconstruction method is then applied to cerebral perfusion MRI simulated as a radial acquisition and contrast-enhanced angiography of the head to assess feasibility in accelerating acquisitions requiring high temporal resolution and accurate representation of contrast kinetics. The I-HYPR algorithm is shown to be more robust than standard HYPR in these applications in which the sparsity condition is not met or in which quantitative information is required. Specifically, iterative reconstruction of undersampled perfusion and contrast-enhanced angiography data improved accuracy of the representation of contrast kinetics and increased the temporal separation of arterial and venous contrast kinetics. The I-HYPR reconstruction may have important diagnostic applications in settings requiring high temporal resolution and quantitative signal dynamics. Because I-HYPR allows relaxation of the sparsity requirements for the composite frame, the iterative reconstruction can enable novel acquisition strategies that independently optimize the quality of the composite and temporal resolution of the dynamic frames.},

	Abstract = {Time-resolved contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography (CE-MRA) has gained in popularity relative to X-ray Digital Subtraction Angiography because it provides three-dimensional (3-D) spatial resolution and it is less invasive. We have previously presented methods that improve temporal resolution in CE-MRA while providing high spatial resolution by employing an undersampled 3-D projection (3D PR) trajectory. The increased coverage and isotropic resolution of the 3D PR acquisition simplify visualization of the vasculature from any perspective. We present a new algorithm to develop a set of time-resolved 3-D image volumes by preferentially weighting the 3D PR data according to its acquisition time. An iterative algorithm computes a series of density compensation functions for a regridding reconstruction, one for each time frame, that exploit the variable sampling density in 3D PR. The iterative weighting procedure simplifies the calculation of appropriate density compensation for arbitrary sampling patterns, which improve sampling efficiency and, thus, signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio, since it is does not require a closed-form calculation based on geometry. Current medical workstations can display these large four-dimensional studies, however, interactive cine animation of the data is only possible at significantly degraded resolution. Therefore, we also present a method for interactive visualization using powerful graphics cards and distributed processing. Results from volunteer and patient studies demonstrate the advantages of dynamic imaging with high spatial resolution.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To optimize 3D radial ultrashort echo time MRI for high resolution whole-lung imaging. METHODS: 3D radial ultrashort echo time was implemented on a 3T scanner to investigate the effects of: (1) limited field-of-view excitation, (2) variable density readouts, and (3) radial oversampling. Improvements in noise performance and spatial resolution were assessed through simulation and phantom studies. Their effects on lung and airway visualization in five healthy male human subjects (mean age 32 years) were compared qualitatively through blinded ordinal scoring by two cardiothoracic radiologists using a nonparametric Friedman test (P < 0.05). Relative signal difference between endobronchial air and adjacent lung tissue, normalized to nearby vessel, was used as a surrogate for lung tissue signal. Quantitative measures were compared using the paired Student's t-test (P < 0.05). Finally, clinical feasibility was investigated in a patient with interstitial fibrosis. RESULTS: Simulation and phantom studies showed up to 67% improvement in SNR and reduced blurring for short T2* species using all three optimizations. In vivo images showed decreased artifacts and improved lung tissue and airway visualization both qualitatively and quantitatively. CONCLUSION: The use of limited field-of-view excitation, variable readout gradients, and radial oversampling significantly improve the technical quality of 3D radial ultrashort echo time lung images.

	Abstract = {A novel technique for manipulating contrast in projection reconstruction MRI is described. The method takes advantage of the fact that the central region of k-space is oversampled, allowing one to choose different filters to enhance or reduce the amount that each view contributes to the central region, which dominates image contrast. The technique is implemented into a fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence, and it is shown that multiple T(2)-weighted images can be reconstructed from a single image data set. These images are shown to be nearly identical to those acquired with the Cartesian-sampled FSE sequence at different effective echo times. Further, it is demonstrated that T(2) maps can be generated from a single image data set. This technique also has the potential to be useful in dynamic contrast enhancement studies, capable of yielding a series of images at a significantly higher effective temporal resolution than what is currently possible with other methods, without sacrificing spatial resolution.},

	Abstract = {Ultrashort echo time (UTE) imaging with soft-tissue suppression reveals short-T(2) components (typically hundreds of microseconds to milliseconds) ordinarily not captured or obscured by long-T(2) tissue signals on the order of tens of milliseconds or longer. Therefore, the technique enables visualization and quantification of short-T(2) proton signals such as those in highly collagenated connective tissues. This work compares the performance of the three most commonly used long-T(2) suppression UTE sequences, i.e., echo subtraction (dual-echo UTE), saturation via dual-band saturation pulses (dual-band UTE), and inversion by adiabatic inversion pulses (IR-UTE) at 3 T, via Bloch simulations and experimentally in vivo in the lower extremities of test subjects. For unbiased performance comparison, the acquisition parameters are optimized individually for each sequence to maximize short-T(2) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between short- and long-T(2) components. Results show excellent short-T(2) contrast which is achieved with these optimized sequences. A combination of dual-band UTE with dual-echo UTE provides good short-T(2) SNR and CNR with less sensitivity to B(1) homogeneity. IR-UTE has the lowest short-T(2) SNR efficiency but provides highly uniform short-T(2) contrast and is well suited for imaging short-T(2) species with relatively short T(1) such as bone water.},

	Abstract = {Time-resolved contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography (MRA) methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. A method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3D projection reconstruction trajectories. The variable density k-space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k-space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s. This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic. Although undersampling the outer regions of k-space introduces aliased energy into the image, which may compromise resolution, this is not a limiting factor in high-contrast applications such as MRA. Results from phantom and volunteer studies are presented demonstrating isotropic resolution, broad coverage with an isotropic field of view (FOV), minimal projection reconstruction artifacts, and temporal information. In one application, a single breath-hold exam covering the entire pulmonary vasculature generates high-resolution, isotropic imaging volumes depicting the bolus passage.},

	Abstract = {Reconstruction of magnetic resonance images from data not falling on a Cartesian grid is a Fourier inversion problem typically solved using convolution interpolation, also known as gridding. Gridding is simple and robust and has parameters, the grid oversampling ratio and the kernel width, that can be used to trade accuracy for computational memory and time reductions. We have found that significant reductions in computation memory and time can be obtained while maintaining high accuracy by using a minimal oversampling ratio, from 1.125 to 1.375, instead of the typically employed grid oversampling ratio of two. When using a minimal oversampling ratio, appropriate design of the convolution kernel is important for maintaining high accuracy. We derive a simple equation for choosing the optimal Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel for a given oversampling ratio and kernel width. As well, we evaluate the effect of presampling the kernel, a common technique used to reduce the computation time, and find that using linear interpolation between samples adds negligible error with far less samples than is necessary with nearest-neighbor interpolation. We also develop a new method for choosing the optimal presampled kernel. Using a minimal oversampling ratio and presampled kernel, we are able to perform a three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction in one-eighth the time and requiring one-third the computer memory versus using an oversampling ratio of two and a Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a basic framework for constructing a 3D analytical MRI phantom in the Fourier domain. In the image domain the phantom is modeled after the work of Kak and Roberts on a 3D version of the famous Shepp-Logan head phantom. This phantom consists of several ellipsoids of different sizes, orientations, locations, and signal intensities (or gray levels). It will be shown that the k-space signal derived from the phantom can be analytically expressed. As a consequence, it enables one to bypass the need for interpolation in the Fourier domain when testing image-reconstruction algorithms. More importantly, the proposed framework can serve as a benchmark for contrasting and comparing different image-reconstruction techniques in 3D MRI with a non-Cartesian k-space trajectory. The proposed framework can also be adapted for 3D MRI simulation studies in which the MRI parameters of interest may be introduced to the signal intensity from the ellipsoid.},

	Abstract = {In dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, the motion kinetics or the contrast variability are often hard to predict, hampering an appropriate choice of the image update rate or the temporal resolution. A constant azimuthal profile spacing (111.246 degrees), based on the Golden Ratio, is investigated as optimal for image reconstruction from an arbitrary number of profiles in radial MRI. The profile order is evaluated and compared with a uniform profile distribution in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and artifact level. The favorable characteristics of such a profile order are exemplified in two applications on healthy volunteers. First, an advanced sliding window reconstruction scheme is applied to dynamic cardiac imaging, with a reconstruction window that can be flexibly adjusted according to the extent of cardiac motion that is acceptable. Second, a contrast-enhancing k-space filter is presented that permits reconstructing an arbitrary number of images at arbitrary time points from one raw data set. The filter was utilized to depict the T1-relaxation in the brain after a single inversion prepulse. While a uniform profile distribution with a constant angle increment is optimal for a fixed and predetermined number of profiles, a profile distribution based on the Golden Ratio proved to be an appropriate solution for an arbitrary number of profiles.},

	Abstract = {The quantification of sodium MR images from an arbitrary intensity scale into a bioscale fosters image interpretation in terms of the spatially resolved biochemical process of sodium ion homeostasis. A methodology for quantifying tissue sodium concentration using a flexible twisted projection imaging sequence is proposed that allows for optimization of tradeoffs between readout time, signal-to-noise ratio efficiency, and sensitivity to static field susceptibility artifacts. The gradient amplitude supported by the slew rate at each k-space radius regularizes the readout gradient waveform design to avoid slew rate violation. Static field inhomogeneity artifacts are corrected using a frequency-segmented conjugate phase reconstruction approach, with field maps obtained quickly from coregistered proton imaging. High-quality quantitative sodium images have been achieved in phantom and volunteer studies with real isotropic spatial resolution of 7.5 x 7.5 x 7.5 mm(3) for the slow T(2) component in approximately 8 min on a clinical 3-T scanner. After correcting for coil sensitivity inhomogeneity and water fraction, the tissue sodium concentration in gray matter and white matter was measured to be 36.6 +/- 0.6 micromol/g wet weight and 27.6 +/- 1.2 micromol/g wet weight, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Noninvasive visualization of the coronary arteries in vivo is one of the most important goals in cardiovascular imaging. Compared to other paradigms for coronary MR angiography, a free-breathing three-dimensional whole-heart iso-resolution approach simplifies prescription effort, requires less patient cooperation, reduces overall exam time, and supports retrospective reformats at arbitrary planes. However, this approach requires a long continuous acquisition and must account for respiratory and cardiac motion throughout the scan. In this work, a new free-breathing coronary MR angiography technique that reduces scan time and improves robustness to motion is developed. Data acquisition is accomplished using a three-dimensional cones non-Cartesian trajectory, which can reduce the number of readouts 3-fold or more compared to conventional three-dimensional Cartesian encoding and provides greater robustness to motion/flow effects. To further enhance robustness to motion, two-dimensional navigator images are acquired to directly track respiration-induced displacement of the heart and enable retrospective compensation of all acquired data (none discarded) for image reconstruction. In addition, multiple cardiac phases are imaged to support retrospective selection of the best phase(s) for visualizing each coronary segment. Experimental results demonstrate that whole-heart coronary angiograms can be obtained rapidly and robustly with this proposed technique.

	Abstract = {Conventional 2D radial projections suffer from losses in signal-to-noise ratio efficiency because of the nonuniform k-space sampling. In this study, a 2D projection reconstruction method with variable gradient amplitudes is presented to cover the k-space uniformly. The gradient is designed to keep the average sampling density constant. By this, signal-to-noise ratio is increased, and the linear form of the radial trajectory is kept. The simple gradient design and low hardware requirements in respect of slew rate allow an easy implementation at MR scanners. Measurements with the density-adapted 2D radial trajectory were compared with the conventional projection reconstruction method. It is demonstrated that the density-adapted 2D radial trajectory technique provides higher signal-to-noise ratio (up to 28% in brain tissue), less blurring, and fewer artifacts in the presence of magnetic field inhomogeneities than imaging with the conventional 2D radial trajectory scheme. The presented sequence is well-suited for electrocardiographically gated sodium heart MRI and other applications with short relaxation times.},

	Abstract = {Data collection of MRI which is sampled nonuniformly in k-space is often interpolated onto a Cartesian grid for fast reconstruction. The collected data must be properly weighted before interpolation, for accurate reconstruction. We propose a criterion for choosing the weighting function necessary to compensate for nonuniform sampling density. A numerical iterative method to find a weighting function that meets that criterion is also given. This method uses only the coordinates of the sampled data; unlike previous methods, it does not require knowledge of the trajectories and can easily handle trajectories that "cross" in k-space. Moreover, the method can handle sampling patterns that are undersampled in some regions of k-space and does not require a post-gridding density correction. Weighting functions for various data collection strategies are shown. Synthesized and collected in vivo data also illustrate aspects of this method.},

	Abstract = {The problem of handling data that falls on a nonequally spaced grid occurs in numerous fields of science, ranging from radio-astronomy to medical imaging. In MRI, this condition arises when sampling under time-varying gradients in sequences such as echo-planar imaging (EPI), spiral scans, or radial scans. The technique currently being used to interpolate the nonuniform samples onto a Cartesian grid is called the gridding algorithm. In this paper, a new method for uniform resampling is presented that is both optimal and efficient. It is first shown that the resampling problem can be formulated as a problem of solving a set of linear equations Ax = b, where x and b are vectors of the uniform and nonuniform samples, respectively, and A is a matrix of the sinc interpolation coefficients. In a procedure called Uniform Re-Sampling (URS), this set of equations is given an optimal solution using the pseudoinverse matrix which is computed using singular value decomposition (SVD). In large problems, this solution is neither practical nor computationally efficient. Another method is presented, called the Block Uniform Re-Sampling (BURS) algorithm, which decomposes the problem into solving a small set of linear equations for each uniform grid point. These equations are a subset of the original equations Ax = b and are once again solved using SVD. The final result is both optimal and computationally efficient. The results of the new method are compared with those obtained using the conventional gridding algorithm via simulations.},

It allows acquisition of FIDs and is therefore well suited to imaging objects with very short T2. Use of a Bayesian procedure allows (1) an important reduction of scan time to below that of the projection-reconstruction (PR) method by reducing the number of "Cartesian radial" encoding directions, and (2) a good image quality by estimating missing and corrupted Cartesian samples. SRS-FT images reconstructed from FIDs are compared to conventional FT and PR images.},

@article{Chan:2009uq,
	Abstract = {Breast tumor diagnosis requires both high spatial resolution to obtain information about tumor morphology and high temporal resolution to probe the kinetics of contrast uptake. Adaptive sampling of k-space allows images in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to be reconstructed at various spatial or temporal resolutions from the same dataset. However, conventional radial approaches have limited flexibility that restricts image reconstruction to predetermined resolutions. Golden-angle radial k-space sampling achieves flexibility in-plane with samples that are incremented by the golden angle, which fills two-dimensional (2D) k-space with radial spokes that have a relatively uniform angular distribution for any time interval. We extend this method to three-dimensional (3D) radial sampling, or 3D-Projection Reconstruction (3D-PR) using multidimensional golden means, which are derived from modified Fibonacci sequences by an eigenvalue approach. We quantitatively compare this technique to conventional 3D radial methods in terms of the fluctuation in error caused by undersampling artifacts, and show that the golden 3D-PR method can substantially improve the temporal stability of quantitative measurements made from dynamic images when compared to conventional 3D radial approaches of k-space sampling.},

	Abstract = {Look-up tables (LUTs) are a common method for increasing the speed of many algorithms. Their use can be extended to the reconstruction of nonuniformly sampled k-space data using either a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm or a convolution-based gridding algorithm. A table for the DFT would be precalculated arrays of weights describing how each data point affects all of image space. A table for a convolution-based gridding operation would be a precalculated table of weights describing how each data point affects a small k-space neighborhood. These LUT methods were implemented in C++ on a modest personal computer system; they allowed a radial k-space acquisition sequence, consisting of 180 views of 256 points each, to be gridded in 36.2 ms, or, in approximately 800 ns/point. By comparison, a similar implementation of the gridding operation, without LUTs, required 45 times longer (1639.2 ms) to grid the same data. This was possible even while using a 4 x 4 Kaiser-Bessel convolution kernel, which is larger than typically used. These table-based computations will allow real time reconstruction in the future and can currently be run concurrently with the acquisition allowing for completely real-time gridding.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a technique for characterizing the gradient subsystem of a magnetic resonance (MR) system. The technique uses a Fourier-transform analysis to directly measure the k-space trajectory produced by an arbitrary gradient waveform. In addition, the method can be easily extended to multiple dimensions and can be adapted to measuring residual gradient effects such as eddy currents. Several examples of gradient waveform and eddy-current measurements are presented. Also, it is demonstrated how the eddy-current measurements can be parameterized with an impulse-response formalism for later use in system tuning. When compared to a peak-fitting analysis, this technique provides a more direct extraction of the k-space measurements, which reduces the possibility of analysis error. This approach also has several advantages as compared to the conventional eddy-current measurement technique, including the ability to measure very short time constant effects.},

	Abstract = {Fast imaging trajectories are used in MRI to speed up the acquisition process, but imperfections in the gradient system create artifacts in the reconstructed images. Artifacts result from the deviation between k-space trajectories achieved on the scanner and their original prescription. Measuring or approximating actual k-space trajectories with predetermined gradient timing delays reduces the artifacts, but are generally based on a specific trajectory and scan orientation. A single linear time-invariant characterization of the gradient system provides a method to predict k-space trajectories scanned in arbitrary orientations through convolution. This is done efficiently, by comparing the Fourier transforms of the input and measured waveforms of a single high-bandwidth test gradient waveform. This new method is tested for spiral, interleaved echo-planar, and three-dimensional cones imaging, demonstrating its ability to reduce reconstructed image artifacts for various k-space trajectories.},

	Abstract = {Various techniques for k-space trajectory measurement have been described in the literature. Self-encoding gradient techniques are time-consuming due to the high number of phase-encoding steps needed. The approach with localized slices is faster, but its use apparently has not been reported in the context of high spatial resolution experiments. Signals associated with high k-space frequencies may then reach low or even zero values, and this may result in errors in the estimate of the trajectories at the k-space periphery. To overcome this problem without increasing the measurement duration of the localized slice method too much, a new approach is proposed in which an addition dephasing gradient applied prior to the gradient to be measured shifts the signal maximum.},

	Abstract = {Fast imaging applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently involve undersampling of k-space data to achieve the desired temporal resolution. However, high temporal resolution images generated from undersampled data suffer from aliasing artifacts. In radial k-space sampling, this manifests as undesirable streaks that obscure image detail. Compressed sensing reconstruction has been shown to reduce such streak artifacts, based on the assumption of image sparsity. Here, compressed sensing is implemented with three different radial sampling schemes (golden-angle, bit-reversed, and random sampling), which are compared over a range of spatiotemporal resolutions. The sampling methods are implemented in static scenarios where different undersampling patterns could be compared. Results from point spread function studies, simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments show that the choice of radial sampling pattern influences the quality of the final image reconstructed by the compressed sensing algorithm. While evenly undersampled radial trajectories are best for specific temporal resolutions, golden-angle radial sampling results in the least overall error when various temporal resolutions are considered. Reduced temporal fluctuations from aliasing artifacts in golden-angle sampling translates to improved compressed sensing reconstructions overall.},

	Abstract = {The reconstruction of artifact-free images from radially encoded MRI acquisitions poses a difficult task for undersampled data sets, that is for a much lower number of spokes in k-space than data samples per spoke. Here, we developed an iterative reconstruction method for undersampled radial MRI which (i) is based on a nonlinear optimization, (ii) allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge with use of penalty functions, and (iii) deals with data from multiple coils. The procedure arises as a two-step mechanism which first estimates the coil profiles and then renders a final image that complies with the actual observations. Prior knowledge is introduced by penalizing edges in coil profiles and by a total variation constraint for the final image. The latter condition leads to an effective suppression of undersampling (streaking) artifacts and further adds a certain degree of denoising. Apart from simulations, experimental results for a radial spin-echo MRI sequence are presented for phantoms and human brain in vivo at 2.9 T using 24, 48, and 96 spokes with 256 data samples. In comparison to conventional reconstructions (regridding) the proposed method yielded visually improved image quality in all cases.},

	Abstract = {A variable-density k-space sampling method is proposed to reduce aliasing artifacts in MR images. Because most of the energy of an image is concentrated around the k-space center, aliasing artifacts will contain mostly low-frequency components if the k-space is uniformly undersampled. On the other hand, because the outer k-space region contains little energy, undersampling that region will not contribute severe aliasing artifacts. Therefore, a variable-density trajectory may sufficiently sample the central k-space region to reduce low-frequency aliasing artifacts and may undersample the outer k-space region to reduce scan time and to increase resolution. In this paper, the variable-density sampling method was implemented for both spiral imaging and two-dimensional Fourier transform (2DFT) imaging. Simulations, phantom images and in vivo cardiac images show that this method can significantly reduce the total energy of aliasing artifacts. In general, this method can be applied to all types of k-space sampling trajectories.},

	Abstract = {For MRI with non-Cartesian sampling, the conventional approach to reconstructing images is to use the gridding method with a Kaiser-Bessel (KB) interpolation kernel. Recently, Sha et al. [L. Sha, H. Guo, A.W. Song, An improved gridding method for spiral MRI using nonuniform fast Fourier transform, J. Magn. Reson. 162(2) (2003) 250-258] proposed an alternative method based on a nonuniform FFT (NUFFT) with least-squares (LS) design of the interpolation coefficients. They described this LS_NUFFT method as shift variant and reported that it yielded smaller reconstruction approximation errors than the conventional shift-invariant KB approach. This paper analyzes the LS_NUFFT approach in detail. We show that when one accounts for a certain linear phase factor, the core of the LS_NUFFT interpolator is in fact real and shift invariant. Furthermore, we find that the KB approach yields smaller errors than the original LS_NUFFT approach. We show that optimizing certain scaling factors can lead to a somewhat improved LS_NUFFT approach, but the high computation cost seems to outweigh the modest reduction in reconstruction error. We conclude that the standard KB approach, with appropriate parameters as described in the literature, remains the practical method of choice for gridding reconstruction in MRI.},

Comput. 21 (1) (1999) 283] for nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) has been extended to two dimensions to reconstruct images using spiral MRI. The new gridding method, called LS_NUFFT, minimizes the reconstruction approximation error in the Least Square sense by generated convolution kernels that fit for the spiral k-space trajectories. For analytical comparison, the LS_NUFFT has been fitted into a consistent framework with the conventional gridding methods using Kaiser-Bessel gridding and a recently proposed generalized FFT (GFFT) approach. Experimental comparison was made by assessing the performance of the LS_NUFFT with that of the standard direct summation method and the Kaiser-Bessel gridding method, using both digital phantom data and in vivo experimental data. Because of the explicitly optimized convolution kernel in LS_NUFFT, reconstruction results showed that the LS_NUFFT yields smaller reconstruction approximation error than the Kaiser-Bessel gridding method, but with the same computation complexity.},

	Abstract = {MR raw data collected using non-Cartesian method can be transformed on Cartesian grids by traditional gridding algorithm (GA) and reconstructed by Fourier transform. However, its runtime complexity is O(K×N(2)), where resolution of raw data is N×N and size of convolution window (CW) is K. And it involves a large number of matrix calculation including modulus, addition, multiplication and convolution. Therefore, a Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)-based algorithm is proposed to improve the reconstruction efficiency of PROPELLER (a globally recognized non-Cartesian sampling method). Experiment shows a write-write conflict among multiple CUDA threads. This induces an inconsistent result when synchronously convoluting multiple k-space data onto the same grid. To overcome this problem, a reverse gridding algorithm (RGA) was developed. Different from the method of generating a grid window for each trajectory as in traditional GA, RGA calculates a trajectory window for each grid. This is what "reverse" means. For each k-space point in the CW, contribution is cumulated to this grid. Although this algorithm can be easily extended to reconstruct other non-Cartesian sampled raw data, we only implement it based on PROPELLER. Experiment illustrates that this CUDA-based RGA has successfully solved the write-write conflict and its reconstruction speed is 7.5 times higher than that of traditional GA.},

	Abstract = {The 3D Cones k-space trajectory has many desirable properties for rapid and ultra-short echo time magnetic resonance imaging. An algorithm is presented that generates the 3D Cones gradient waveforms given a desired field of view and resolution. The algorithm enables a favorable trade-off between increases in readout time and decreases in the total number of required readouts. The resulting trajectory is very signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficient and has excellent aliasing properties. A rapid high-resolution ultra-short echo time imaging sequence is used to compare the 3D Cones trajectory to 3D projection reconstruction (3DPR) sampling schemes. For equivalent scan times, the 3D Cones trajectory has better SNR performance and fewer aliasing artifacts as compared to the 3DPR trajectory.},

	Abstract = {Despite reduction in imaging times through improved hardware and rapid acquisition schemes, motion artifacts can compromise image quality in magnetic resonance imaging, especially in three-dimensional imaging with its prolonged scan durations. Direct extension of most state-of-the-art two-dimensional rigid body motion compensation techniques to the three-dimensional case is often challenging or impractical due to a significant increase in sampling requirements. This article introduces a novel motion correction technique that is capable of restoring image quality in motion corrupted two-dimensional and three-dimensional radial acquisitions without a priori assumptions about when motion occurs. The navigating properties of radial acquisitions-corroborated by multiple receiver coils-are exploited to detect actual instances of motion. Pseudorandom projection ordering provides flexibility of reconstructing navigator images from the obtained motion-free variable-width subsets for subsequent estimation of rigid body motion parameters by coregistration. The proposed approach does not require any additional navigators or external motion estimation schemes. The capabilities and limitations of the method are described and demonstrated through simulations and representative volunteer cranial acquisitions.

	Abstract = {PROPELLER MRI (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction) provides images with significantly fewer B(0)-related artifacts than echo-planar imaging (EPI), as well as reduced sensitivity to motion compared to conventional multiple-shot fast spin-echo (FSE). However, the minimum imaging time in PROPELLER is markedly longer than in EPI and 50% longer than in conventional multiple-shot FSE. Often in MRI, imaging time is reduced by undersampling k-space. In the present study, the effects of undersampling on PROPELLER images were evaluated using simulated and in vivo data sets. Undersampling using PROPELLER patterns with reduced number of samples per line, number of lines per blade, or number of blades per acquisition, while maintaining the same k-space field of view (FOV(k)) and uniform sampling at the edges of FOV(k), reduced imaging time but led to severe image artifacts. In contrast, undersampling by means of removing whole blades from a PROPELLER sampling pattern that sufficiently samples k-space produced only minimal image artifacts, mainly manifested as blurring in directions parallel to the blades removed, even when reducing imaging time by as much as 50%. Finally, undersampling using asymmetric blades and taking advantage of Hermitian symmetries to fill-in the missing data significantly reduced imaging time without causing image artifacts.},

	Abstract = {A variant of periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) MRI, called turboprop, is introduced. This method employs an oscillating readout gradient during each spin echo of the echo train to collect more lines of data per echo train, which reduces the minimum scan time, motion-related artifact, and specific absorption rate (SAR) while increasing sampling efficiency. It can be applied to conventional fast spin-echo (FSE) imaging; however, this article emphasizes its application in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The method is described and compared with conventional PROPELLER imaging, and clinical images collected with this PROPELLER variant are shown.},

	Abstract = {Sampling density-weighted apodization projection reconstruction sequences are evaluated for three-dimensional radial imaging. The readout gradients of the sampling density-weighted apodization sequence are designed such that the locally averaged sampling density matches a Hamming filter function. This technique is compared with density-adapted projection reconstruction with nonfiltered and postfiltered image reconstruction. Sampling density-weighted apodization theoretically allows for a 1.28-fold higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with postfiltered density-adapted projection reconstruction sequences, if T 2* decay is negligible compared with the readout duration T(RO) . Simulations of the point-spread functions are performed for monoexponential and biexponential decay to investigate the effects of T 2* decay on the performance of the different sequences. Postfiltered density-adapted projection reconstruction performs superior to sampling density-weighted apodization for large T(RO) /T 2* ratios [>1.36 (monoexponential decay); >0.35 (biexponential decay with T 2s*/T 2f* = 10)], if signal-to-noise ratio of point-like objects is considered. In conclusion, it depends on the readout parameters, the T 2* relaxation times, and the dimensions of the subject which of both sequences is most suitable.

	Abstract = {Subject motion during scan is a major source of artifacts in MR examinations. Prospective motion correction is a promising technique that tracks subject motion and adjusts the imaging volume in real time; however, additional retrospective correction may be necessary to achieve robust image quality and compatibility with other imaging options. Real-time realignment of the imaging volume by prospective motion correction changes the coil sensitivity weighting and the field inhomogeneity relative to the imaging volume. This can pose image reconstruction problems with parallel imaging and partial Fourier imaging, which rely on coil sensitivity and image phase information, respectively. This work presents a practical method for reconstructing images acquired using prospective motion correction with parallel imaging and/or partial Fourier imaging. Our proposed approach is data driven and noniterative; data are binned into several position bins based on motion measurements made during the prospective motion correction acquisition and the data in each bin are processed through intrabin operations such as parallel imaging reconstruction (in case of undersampling), phase correction, and coil combination before combination of the position bins. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique through simulation studies and in vivo experiments using a prospectively motion-corrected three-dimensional fast spin echo sequence.

	Abstract = {Cine balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) is the most widely used sequence for assessing cardiac ventricular function at 1.5 T because it provides high signal-to-noise ratio efficiency and strong contrast between myocardium and blood. At 3 T, the use of SSFP is limited by susceptibility-induced off-resonance, resulting in either banding artifacts or the need to use a short-sequence pulse repetition time that limits the readout duration and hence the achievable spatial resolution. In this work, we apply wideband SSFP, a variant of SSFP that uses two alternating pulse repetition times to establish a steady state with wider band spacing in its frequency response and overcome the key limitations of SSFP. Prospectively gated cine two-dimensional imaging with wideband SSFP is evaluated in healthy volunteers and compared to conventional balanced SSFP, using quantitative metrics and qualitative interpretation by experienced clinicians. We demonstrate that by trading off temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio efficiency, wideband SSFP mitigates banding artifacts and enables imaging with approximately 30% higher spatial resolution compared to conventional SSFP with the same effective band spacing.},

	Abstract = {A technique for extended field of view MRI is presented. Similar to helical computed tomography, the method utilizes a continuously moving patient table, a 2D axial slice that remains fixed relative to the MRI magnet, and a radial k-space trajectory. A fully refocused SSFP acquisition enables spatial resolution comparable to current clinical protocols in scan times that are sufficiently short to allow a reasonable breathhold duration. RF transmission and signal reception are performed using the RF body coil and the images are reconstructed in real time. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the technique's ability to resolve small structures in the table-motion direction. Simulation experiments to study the steady-state response of the fully refocused SSFP acquisition during continuous table motion are also presented. Finally, whole body images of healthy volunteers demonstrate the high image quality achieved using the helical MRI approach.},
